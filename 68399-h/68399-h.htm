<h3>I</h3>

<p>Bruce Storrs stood up tall and straight on a prostrate
sycamore, the sunlight gleaming upon his lithe, vigorous
body, and with a quick, assured lifting of the arms
plunged into the cool depths of the river. He rose and
swam with long, confident strokes the length of a pool
formed by the curving banks and returned to the log,
climbing up with the same ease and grace that marked
his swimming. He dashed the water from his eyes
and pressed his deeply-tanned hands over his shapely
head. It was evident that he was the fortunate inheritor
of clean blood in a perfectly fashioned body; that
he had used himself well in his twenty-eight years and
that he found satisfaction and pride in his health and
strength. He surveyed the narrow valley through
which the river idled and eddied before rushing into
the broader channel beyond—surveyed it with something
of the air of a discoverer who has found and
appropriated to his own uses a new corner of the world.</p>

<p>It was a good place to be at the end of a day that
was typical of late August in the corn belt, a day of
intense dry heat with faint intimations on the horizon
of the approach of autumn. With a contented sigh he
sat down on the log, his feet drawn up, his shoulders<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>
bent, and aimlessly tore bits of bark from the log and
tossed them into the water. Lulled by the lazy ripple,
he yielded himself to reverie and his eyes filled with
dreams as he stared unseeingly across the stream. Suddenly
he raised his head resolutely as if his thoughts
had returned to the world of the actual and he had
reached a conclusion of high importance. He plunged
again and now his short, rapid strokes threshed the
water into foam. One might have thought that in the
assertion of his physical strength he was testing and
reassuring himself of his complete self-mastery.</p>

<p>Refreshed and invigorated, he clambered up the bank
and sought a great beech by whose pillar-like trunk he
had left his belongings, and proceeded to dress. From
a flat canvas bag he produced a towel and a variety of
toilet articles. He combed his thick curly hair, donned
a flannel shirt and knotted a blue scarf under its soft
collar. His shoes of brogan type bore the imprint of
a metropolitan maker and his gray knickerbockers and
jacket indicated a capable tailor.</p>

<p>He took from the bag a package of letters addressed
in a woman’s hand to Bruce Storrs, and making himself
comfortable with his back to the tree, he began
to read. The letters had been subjected to many readings,
as their worn appearance testified, but selecting
the bulkiest, he perused it carefully, as though wishing
to make sure that its phrases were firmly fixed in his
memory.</p>

<p>“... Since my talk with you,” he read, “I have had
less pain, but the improvement is only temporary—the
doctors do not deceive me as to that. I may go quickly—any
day, any hour. You heard my story the other
night—generously, with a fine tolerance, as I knew you
would. If I had not been so satisfied of your sense of
justice and so sure of your love, I could never have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>
told you. But from the hour I knew that my life was
nearing its end I felt more and more that you must
know. One or two things I’m afraid I didn’t make
clear ... that I loved the man who is your father.
Love alone could be my justification—without that I
could never have lived through these years.</p>

<p>“The man you have called father never suspected the
truth. He trusted me. It has been part of my punishment
that through all these years I have had to endure
the constant manifestations of his love and confidence.
But for that one lapse in the second year of my marriage,
I was absolutely faithful in all my obligations
to him. And he was kind to you and proud of you.
He did all for you that a father could, never dreaming
that you were not his own. It was one of my sorrows
that I couldn’t give him a child of his own. Things
went badly with him in his last years, as you know,
and what I leave to you—it will be about fifty thousand
dollars—I inherited from my father, and it will help
you find your place in the world.</p>

<p>“Your father has no idea of your existence....
Ours was a midsummer madness, at a time when we
were both young. I only knew him a little while, and
I have never heard from him. My love for him never
wholly died. Please, dear, don’t think harshly of me,
but there have been times when I would have given my
life for a sight of him. After all you are his—his as
much as mine. You came to me from him—strangely
dear and beautiful. In my mind you have always been
his, and I loved you the dearer. I loved him, but I
could not bring myself to leave the man you have
called father for him. He was not the kind of man
women run away with....</p>

<p>“When I’m gone I want you to put yourself near
him—learn to know him, if that should be possible. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
am trusting you. You would never, I know, do him an
injury. Some day he may need you. Remember, he
does not know—it may be he need never know. But
oh, be kind to him....”</p>

<p>He stared at the words. Had it been one of those
unaccountable affairs—he had heard of such—where a
gently reared woman falls prey to a coarse-fibered
man in every way her inferior? The man might be
common, low, ignorant and cruel. Bruce had been
proud of his ancestry. The Storrs were of old American
stock, and his mother’s family, the Bruces, had
been the foremost people in their county for nearly a
century. He had taken a pardonable pride in his background....
That night when he had stumbled out of
the house after hearing his mother’s confession he had
felt the old friendly world recede. The letters, sealed
and entrusted to the family physician for delivery at
her death, merely repeated what she had told him.</p>

<p>In his constant rereadings he had hoped that one day
he would find that he had misinterpreted the message.
He might dismiss his mother’s story as the fabrication
of a sick woman’s mind. But today he knew the folly
of this; the disclosure took its place in his mind among
the unalterable facts of his life. At first he had
thought of destroying himself; but he was too sane
and the hope of life was too strong for such a solution
of his problem. And there had been offers—flattering
ones—to go to New York and Boston. He convinced
himself that his mother could not seriously have meant
to limit the range of his opportunities by sending him to
the city where his unknown father lived. But he was
resolved not to shirk; he would do her bidding. There
was a strain of superstition in him: he might invite misfortune
by disregarding her plea; and moreover he had
the pride and courage of youth. No one knew, no one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
need ever know! He had escaped from the feeling, at
first poignant, that shame attached to him; that he
must slink through life under the eyes of a scornful
world. No; he had mastered that; his pride rallied;
he felt equal to any demand fate might make upon him;
he was resolved to set his goal high....</p>

<p>Life had been very pleasant in Laconia, the Ohio
town where John Storrs had been a lawyer of average
attainments—in no way brilliant, but highly respected
for his probity and enjoying for years a fair practice.
Bruce had cousins of his own age, cheery, wholesome
contemporaries with whom he had chummed from
childhood. The Storrs, like the Bruces, his mother’s
people, were of a type familiar in Mid-western county
seats, kindly, optimistic, well-to-do folk, not too contented
or self-satisfied to be unaware of the stir and
movement of the larger world.</p>

<p>The old house, built in the forties by John Storrs’s
grandfather, had become suddenly to Bruce a strange
and alien place that denied his right of occupancy. The
elms in the yard seemed to mock him, whispering, “You
don’t belong here!” and as quickly as possible he had
closed the house, made excuses to his relatives, given a
power of attorney to the president of the local bank, an
old friend, to act for him in all matters, and announced
that he’d look about a bit and take a vacation before
settling down to his profession.</p>

<p>This was all past now and he had arrived, it seemed
inevitably, at the threshold of the city where his father
lived.</p>

<p>The beauty of the declining day stirred longings
and aspirations, definite and clear, in his mind and
heart. His debt to his mother was enormous. He
remembered now her happiness at the first manifestation
of his interest in form, color and harmony; her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
hand guiding his when he first began to draw; her
delight in his first experiment with a box of colors,
given him on one of his birthdays. Yes; he should be
a painter; that came first; then his aptitude in modeling
made it plain that sculpture was to be his true vocation.
To be a creator of beautiful things!—here, she had
urged, lay the surest hope of happiness.</p>

<p>Very precious were all these memories; they brought
a wistful smile to his face. She had always seemed
to him curiously innocent, with the innocence of light-hearted
childhood. To think of her as carrying a stain
through her life was abhorrent. Hers was the blithest,
cheeriest spirit he had known. The things she had
taught him to reverence were a testimony to her innate
fineness; she had denied herself for him, jealously
guarding her patrimony that it might pass to him intact.
The manly part for him was to live in the light
of the ideals she had set for him. Pity and love for
one who had been so sensitive to beauty in all its forms
touched him now; brought a sob to his throat. He
found a comfort in the thought that her confession
might be attributable to a hope that in his life her sin
might be expiated....</p>

<p>He took up the letters and turned them over
for the last time, his eyes caught and held now and
then by some phrase. He held the sheets against his
face for a moment, then slowly tore them into strips,
added the worn envelopes and burned them. Not content
with this, he trampled the charred fragments into
the sandy turf.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>The sun, a huge brazen ball, was low in the west
when he set off along the river with confident, springy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
step. He stopped at a farmhouse and asked for supper.
The evening meal was over, the farmer’s wife explained;
but when he assured her that his needs were
few and that he expected to pay for his entertainment,
she produced a pitcher of milk and a plate of corn
bread. She brought a bowl of yellow glaze crockery
and he made himself comfortable on a bench by the
kitchen door. He crumbled the bread into the creamy
milk and ate with satisfaction.</p>

<p>Her husband appeared, and instantly prejudiced by
Bruce’s knickerbockers, doggedly quizzed him as to
the nature and direction of his journey. Bruce was
a new species, not to be confused with the ordinary
tramp who demands food at farmhouses, and suddenly
contrite that the repast she was providing was so
meager, the woman rose and disappeared into the
kitchen, returning with a huge piece of spice cake and
a dish of sliced peaches. She was taken aback when
he rose deferentially to accept the offering, but her
tired face relaxed in a smile at his cordial expressions
of gratitude. She joined her husband on the stoop,
finding the handsome pilgrim’s visit a welcome break
in the monotonous day. As he ate he answered their
questions unhurriedly.</p>

<p>“I guess the war left a lot o’ you boys restless,” she
suggested.</p>

<p>“Oh, it wasn’t the war that made a rover of me!”
he replied with a smile. “It was this way with me.
When I got home I found I had something to think
out—something I had to get used to”—he frowned
and became silent for a moment—“so I decided I could
do it better by tramping. But I’ve settled things in
my own mind pretty well now,” he ended, half to himself,
and smiled, hardly aware of their presence.</p>

<p>“Yes?” The woman’s tone was almost eager. She<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
was curious as to the real reason for his wanderings
and what it was that he had settled. In the luminous
afterglow her dull imagination quickened to a sense of
something romantic in this stranger, and she was disappointed
when he told of an experience as a laborer
in a great steel mill, just to see what it was like, he
said—of loitering along the Susquehanna, and of a
more recent tramp through the Valley of Virginia.</p>

<p>“I reckon you don’t have to work?” the farmer asked,
baffled in his attempts to account for a young man who
strolled over the country so aimlessly, wearing what
struck him as an outlandish garb.</p>

<p>“Oh, but I do! I’ve done considerable work as I’ve
sauntered around. I’m an architect—or hope to be!
I’ve earned my keep as I’ve traveled by getting jobs
as a draughtsman.”</p>

<p>“Going to stop in the city?” the woman inquired.
“I guess there’s lots of architects over there.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” Bruce replied, following the direction of her
glance.</p>

<p>“You know folks there?” she persisted. “I guess
it’s hard getting started if you ain’t got friends.”</p>

<p>“There’s a chap living there I knew in college; that’s
all. But when you strike a strange town where you
don’t know anyone the only thing to do is to buckle in
and make them want to know you!”</p>

<p>“I guess you can do that,” she remarked with shy
admiration.</p>

<p>The farmer shuffled his feet on the brick walk. For
all he knew the young stranger might be a burglar. He
resented his wife’s tone of friendliness and resolved
to deny the request if the young man asked the privilege
of sleeping in the barn; but the stranger not only
failed to ask for lodging, but produced a dollar bill
and insisted that the woman accept it. This transaction<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
served instantly to dispel the farmer’s suspicions.
He answered with unnecessary detail Bruce’s
questions as to the shortest way to town, and walked
with him to a lane that ran along the edge of a cornfield
and afforded a short cut to the highway.</p>

<p>Bruce had expected to reach the city before nightfall,
but already the twilight was deepening and the first
stars glimmered in the pale sky. Now that he was
near the end of his self-imposed wanderings, he experienced
a sense of elation. The unhappy thoughts with
which he had left his Ohio home a little more than a
year earlier had gradually become dim in his memory.
The letters he had burned at the riverside really marked
in his consciousness a dispersion of doubts and questions
that left his spirit free. His mother’s revelation
had greatly shaken him; but she need never have told
him; and it spoke for her courage and her faith in him
that she had confessed the truth. They had been companions
in an unusual sense. From his earliest youth
she had interested him in the things that had been her
delight—books, music, pictures. She was herself an
accomplished musician, and strains of old melodies she
had taught him recurred to him now, and as he swung
along the country road he whistled them, happy for the
first time in the awakening of old memories.</p>

<p>With the cool breeze blowing upon him from fields
of tall ripening corn, there was no bitterness in his
soul. He had beaten down the bitter thoughts that had
assailed him in the early days of his journeying—the
sense that a stigma attached to him, not the less hateful
because he alone had knowledge of it; and the feeling
that there was something fantastic in the idea that he
should put himself where, in any need, he could serve
the father he had never known.</p>

<p>This had now all the sanctity of a commission from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
the dead. Again he speculated as to what manner of
man this could be who had awakened so deep a love
in the heart of the good woman he knew his mother
to have been—a love which she had carried in her
heart to her last hours. In his long ponderings he
had, he felt, come to understand her better than he
ever had in her lifetime—her imaginative and romantic
side, her swiftly changing moods, her innumerable
small talents that had now a charm and a pathos in the
retrospect. Age had never, to his eyes, laid hands upon
her. Even through the last long illness she had retained
the look and the spirit of youth.</p>

<p>Rounding a bend in the river, the flare of an amusement
park apprised him that he was close upon the city—a
city he had heretofore never visited and knew of
only from his newspaper reading as a prosperous industrial
center. Here, for the strangest reason in the
world, he was to make his home, perhaps spend the
remainder of his days! He crossed a stone bridge with
a sense that the act marked an important transition in
his life, and quickly passing through the park, boarded
a trolley car and rode into town.</p>

<p>He had formed a very clear idea of what he meant
to do, and arriving at the business center he went
directly to the Hotel Fordham, to which he had expressed
his trunk from Cincinnati.</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>He spent an hour unpacking and overhauling his
belongings, wrote notes to his banker friend in Laconia
and to the cousin there with whom he had maintained
a correspondence since he first went away to school.</p>

<p>The pencil with which he idly scribbled on a sheet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
of hotel paper traced his name unconsciously. <i>Bruce
Storrs.</i></p>

<p>It was not his name; he had no honest right to it.
He had speculated many times in his wanderings as to
whether he shouldn’t change it, but this would lead to
endless embarrassments. Now, with his thoughts crystalized
by the knowledge that this other man who had
been his mother’s lover was within reach, he experienced
a strong sense of loyalty to the memory of the man he
had called father. It would be a contemptible thing
to abandon the name of one who had shown him so
tender an affection and understood so perfectly his
needs and aims.</p>

<p>Somewhere among the several hundred thousand
people of the city about him was the man his mother
had described. In the quiet room he experienced suddenly
a feeling of loneliness. Usually in his wanderings
he had stopped at cheap lodging houses, and the
very comfort of his surroundings now added to his
feeling of strangeness in having at last arrived at a
goal which marked not merely the end of his physical
wandering, but the termination of a struggle with his
own spirit.</p>

<p>He sent down for the evening papers and found
himself scanning carefully the local news, thinking
that he might find some clue to the activities of Franklin
Mills.</p>

<p>His attention was immediately caught by the caption,
“Franklin Mills Sells Site of Old Homestead to
Trust Company.” The name fell like a blow upon
his consciousness. He seized the telephone book and
hurriedly turned the pages.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Mills Franklin—r 5800 Jefferson Ave...King 1322</div>
<div class="verse">Mills Franklin—1821 First Ntl Bnk....Main 2222</div>
</div></div>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>He stared at the two lines till they were a blur before
his eyes. There was but one man of the name in the
directory; there could be no mistake as to his identity.</p>

<p>It was a disconcerting thought that by calling these
numbers he might at any time hear Franklin Mills’s
voice. The idea both fascinated and repelled him.
What, after all, had he to do with Franklin Mills?</p>

<p>He turned to the newspaper and reread the report of
the real estate transaction, then opened to the personal
and society page, where he found this item:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Miss Leila Mills of Jefferson Avenue gave a
luncheon yesterday at the Faraway Country Club
for her house guest, Miss Helene Ridgeway of
Cincinnati. The decorations were purple asters
and pink roses.</p>
</div>

<p>Helene Ridgeway he knew; she had been the college
chum of one of his Laconia cousins. He had not realized
the strain he had undergone in the past year till he
saw the familiar name. The nightmare pictures of his
year-long speculations faded; whatever else Mills might
be he was at least a reputable citizen, and this was
something to be thankful for; and obviously he was
not poor and helpless.</p>

<p>The Leila referred to must be Mills’s daughter, and
the same blood ran in her veins as in his own. Bruce
flung the paper away; touched his forehead, found it
covered with perspiration. He paced the floor till he
had quieted himself, paused at the window, finding
relief in the lights and sounds of the street, the bells
and whistles of trains at the railway station somewhere
in the distance. The world surged round him, indifferent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
to his hopes and aims and fears. He must keep
tight hold of himself....</p>

<p>His mother had urged him to think kindly of Franklin
Mills; and yet, now that the man was within reach,
a contempt that bordered upon hatred filled his heart.
For his mother his love turned for the moment to pity.
He recalled the look she had bent upon him at times
when he and his putative father had talked happily
together. John Storrs had lavished an unusual devotion
upon his wife to the end of his life. The wrong done
him seemed monstrous as Bruce thought of it, remembering
Storrs’s pride in him, the sympathetic interest he
had taken in his education, the emotion with which
they had parted when Bruce went away to war. There
was a vast pathos in all this—in the very ignorance of
his wife’s infidelity that John Storrs had carried to his
grave.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER TWO</h2>
</div>


<h3>I</h3>

<p>Awake early, Bruce donned a freshly-pressed gray
suit and went down to breakfast. His immediate concern
was to find employment, for in work, he knew, lay
his hope of happiness and peace. He had thrust into his
pocket letters from architects who had employed him in
various cities commending him as an excellent draughtsman;
and he bore a letter certifying to his good character
and trustworthiness from the president of the
bank in his native town. He was not pressed by immediate
need. His travels had been inexpensive; in fact,
he had a little more than earned his way; and he had
not only the fifty thousand dollars his mother had left
invested in securities, but he carried drafts for the
accumulated income—something over a thousand dollars—to
tide him over any possible difficulties in finding
an opening that promised well for the future. He had
finished his breakfast, and lingered at the table, deep
in thought, when a young man who had just entered
the dining-room paused beside him.</p>

<p>“Is it or is it not Bruce Storrs?” he demanded. “I
spotted you from the door—didn’t think there could
be another such head and shoulders.”</p>

<p>“Bud Henderson!”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>Storrs was on his feet, wringing the hand of the
young man, who was regarding him with a pleased
grin.</p>

<p>“You good old Indian! I was just about to go out
and ask the nearest cop where to find you! You’re
the only man in town I know!”</p>

<p>“Thanks for the compliment. You might have
warned me of your approach. I’ll sit right here and
eat while you unfold yourself.”</p>

<p>Henderson was short, lean and dark, with a curiously
immobile face. His lips smiled oddly without any
accompanying expression of humor in his rather small
brown eyes. Without inquiring what had brought
Storrs to town, he began talking of their years together
at Boston, where they had been fellow students at the
Tech. He had a dry, humorous way of saying things,
particularly when he talked of himself, which puzzled
strangers but delighted his friends. He was treating
Storrs quite as though there had been no break in
their intercourse.</p>

<p>“Met some of our old Boston pals during the recent
unpleasantness and heard of you occasionally on the
other side,” he was saying. “Frankly, I’m not keen
about war”—he was composedly eating a melon—“war
is fatiguing. I hope the great nations will behave for
the rest of my life, so I won’t be annoyed by having
to go out and settle the row.”</p>

<p>“Here too, Bud; I got enough. I want to have a
try at the arts of peace.”</p>

<p>“So say we all. By the way, are you married yet?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“That’s bad. Marriage is an honorable estate; I’m
rather keen about it. I took me a wife as soon as I
got back from France. Oh, Lord, no! None of the
girls we knew around Boston. Couldn’t afford them,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
and besides it’s a mistake not to marry in your home
town, and it’s also easier when you’re a bloomin’
pauper. I married into one of the strongest wholesale
grocery houses in all these parts. I’ll drive you by
the warehouse, an impressive pile—one of the biggest
concerns west of Pittsburgh. Maybelle is the name of
the lucky girl, and Maybelle is the only child of the
Conrad of Conrad, Buxton and Pettibone. A wonderful
girl—one of the really strong, powerful women of
this great nation. She’s out of town at present, playing
a golf tournament for the huckleberry association
championship. That’s why I’m chasing downtown for
breakfast—cook’s on a vacation. You’ll meet Maybelle;
she’s a person, that girl! Married me out of
pity; thinks I’m half-witted, and right, at that!”</p>

<p>“Of course you’d have to marry a girl who’d make
allowance for your mental infirmities,” Bruce replied.
“Getting on in your profession, I suppose?”</p>

<p>“Hell, no! I chucked that. There are too many
really capable electrical experts, and after Maybelle’s
father had tried me for six months in the grocery and
I failed to show any talent for distributing the well-known
Verbena Brand of canned stuff, he set me up in
the automobile business. Shameful to relate, I really
make money. I handle the Plantagenet—one of the
worst cars on the market. You know it was a mistake—my
feeling that I was called to be another Edison
or Marconi. I was really cut out for the literary life—another
sad case of mute, inglorious Milton. I exercise
my talents now designing ‘ads’ and come-on letters
as a lure to customers for the Plantagenet. Would you
ride with kings? The Plantagenet is the car that takes
you out and brings you back. That’s my latest slogan;
you’ll find it glaring at you all over the landscape.”</p>

<p>“Oh, what a fall, my countryman!”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>“Not at all. You know I always had a knack of
making phrases. It’s a gift, my boy. I suppose you’re
here to figure on a new state-house or perhaps a hospital
for lame cats. I know nearly everybody in town,
so if I can be of use to you, just warble.”</p>

<p>“My aim isn’t so high,” said Bruce, who remembered
Henderson as somewhat eccentric but the kindest
of souls. His manner of talking was no indication
of his true character. Bruce’s heart warmed to Henderson;
already the town seemed less strange, and he at
once disclosed his intention of establishing himself in
the city, though without in the least surprising the imperturbable
Bud.</p>

<p>“Welcome!” he exclaimed with his mouth full of
toast. “You shall be our Michelangelo, our Sir Christopher
Wren! I see, as in a dream,” he went on as he
thrust his fork into a poached egg, “I see our fair city
adorned with the noble fruits of the genius of Bruce
Storrs, the prince of architects. You will require a
fleet of Plantagenets to whirl you from one rising edifice
to another. I might make you a special price on
six cars—but this must be confidential.”</p>

<p>“I really want to get into a good office, and I’m not
expecting to be taken right into the firm,” said Bruce,
laughing. “It will take me a year or two to get
acquainted, and then I’d like to set up for myself.”</p>

<p>“Certainly a worthy ambition, Bruce. It’s a good
thing I’m here on the ground to give you the true dope
on the people who count in this teeming village. The
old order changeth, yielding place to new, and there’s
danger of getting pinched between the old hard-boiled
bunch and the birds of gayer plumage who flew in
when no one was looking and insist on twittering
sweetly on our tallest trees. Let me be your social
booster; no one better fitted. I’m the only scion of one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
of our earliest and noblest families. My grandfather’s
bank busted in seventy-three with a loud bang and I
had an uncle who was indicted for embezzling public
funds. He hid in Patagonia and died there in sinful
splendor at a ripe old age. Talk about the aristocracy—I’m
it! I derive a certain prestige among what you
might call the paralytic group from the fact that my
ancestors were mixed up in all the financial calamities
that ever befell this town. But it’s the crowd that are
the spenders—build the lordly palaces and treat the
Eighteenth Amendment with the contempt it so richly
deserves—that you want to train with. Your profession
is cursed with specialization and I’d warn you
against public work. Too much politics there for one
of your fastidious nature. Our best man in domestic
architecture is Freeman—he’s a Tech man, about seven
years ahead of our class. He has a weakness for sun
parlors with antique Italian fountains that are made
for him special by a pottery right here in town. You’re
sure to like Freeman; he’s a whist fiend, but otherwise
he’s a decent chap. His wife and Maybelle are chums
and we play around together a good deal.”</p>

<p>While listening to Henderson’s rambling talk Bruce
had been turning over the pages of a memorandum
book. He asked about several architects whose names
he had noted. Henderson described them succinctly,
praising or deriding them for reasons which struck
Bruce as not necessarily final as to their merits.</p>

<p>“I don’t expect to land a job the first day,” said
Bruce. “I may have to go through the list before I
find what I want.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Freeman will take you on,” replied Henderson
easily. “But he never does anything important without
consulting his wife—one of his eccentricities. My
own system is to go ahead and tell Maybelle afterward,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
being careful, of course, to conceal my mistakes.”</p>

<p>“You haven’t changed a bit,” laughed Bruce. “I
wish I could view the world as chipperly as you do.”</p>

<p>“My dear Bruce”—with his forefinger Henderson
swept Storrs’s breakfast check to his own side of the
table with a single gesture—“never try to view the
whole world at one glance; it’s too damned big. All
I see at present on this suffering, sinning planet is a
Plantagenet runabout with Maybelle and me rolling
through fields of asphodel. Everything else is superfluous.
My fellow creatures simply don’t exist except
as prospects for the Plantagenet.”</p>

<p>“Oh, rot! You’re the most unselfish biped I ever
knew!”</p>

<p>“Superficially, yes; but it’s all on the surface. Let’s
go out and plant our feet firmly upon the city.”</p>

<p>He led the way to his car and drove to the Plantagenet
salesroom and garage. A young woman whom
he introduced as Miss Ordway apparently ran the whole
establishment. Henderson said that she did. He sat
down at his desk and signed, without reading, a pile
of letters which she had written the day before, talking
to her meantime, not of business, but of a novel he had
given her to read. Her attempts to interest him in the
fact that one of the salesmen wanted his assistance in
rounding up a certain difficult customer were provocative
only of scornful comments, but when she handed
him a memorandum of an appointment with the prospect
at ten o’clock the next morning, he meekly thrust
the paper into his pocket and said all right; he’d see
what he could do. Miss Ordway was already busy
with other matters; she seemed to make due allowance
for her employer’s peculiarities.</p>

<p>“This girl’s mighty firm with me,” he said in a tone<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
perfectly audible to Miss Ordway. “A cruel tyrant;
but she really does get some work out of me.”</p>

<p>He sat on the edge of his desk as he talked over
the extension telephone. Bruce inferred that he was
speaking to Mrs. Freeman, and it was evident from his
tone that Bud had not exaggerated in speaking of his
intimacy with the architect and his wife.</p>

<p>“Maybelle’s pushing the pill somewhere and won’t
be back for a week. This being Friday, I’d like to be
invited to your shanty for the week-end.... Ah!
That’s nice of you. And may I bring a little friend?...
Oh, a man, of course! And list, Dale, he’s an
architect—a Tech grad and everything pretty, and I
want Bill to take him on—see? Nice boy and perishing
for a job. You fix it for me—that’s the girl!...
Oh! my friend isn’t fussy; we’ll both sleep on the
grass.... What? Yes; I’ll bring some poison; my
pet bootlegger broke through the entanglements yesterday.”</p>

<p>“All set,” he remarked as he hung up the receiver.
“Mighty nice girl, Dale.”</p>

<p>Miss Ordway intercepted him on his way out to ask
what she should do about a claim for damages to a
car belonging to a man named Smythe, which had been
scratched in the garage. The owner threatened to sue,
and Miss Ordway expressed the belief that the valued
patron was not bluffing.</p>

<p>“We took the stand it wasn’t done in our shop and
we can’t weaken,” said Henderson. “Also, we don’t
want a row. Were my eyes deceiving me or have I
seen Smythe looking longingly at that blue touring car
in our front window? Yes? Well, suppose we send
Briggs to call on him, carrying the olive branch. Tell
him to roll home in the blue car and we’ll take his old
junk and seven hundred berries cash on the counter.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>“I think we could get eight hundred on the deal.”
Miss Ordway’s tones were crisp and businesslike.</p>

<p>“Sold! I despise Smythe, but it’s worth a thousand
to have him riding in a Plantagenet. I’ll look in
again at five.”</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>Henderson spent the morning exhibiting the city’s
industries and wound up at the University Club for
luncheon.</p>

<p>“Now I’ll show you where the big frogs of our little
puddle live,” he said as they started off again.</p>

<p>In his racy description of the owners of the houses
they passed, their ancestry, the skeletons in their closets,
their wealth and how it was attained, Henderson shone
effulgently. Bruce, marveling that one head could
carry so much local history, was almost equally astonished
by the sins and foibles of the citizens as Henderson
pictured them.</p>

<p>“Great Scott! Are there no perfectly normal people
in this town?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“A few, maybe,” Henderson replied, lifting his hand
from the wheel to stroke his chin. “But they’re not
what you’d call conspicuous.”</p>

<p>Pausing before a handsome colonial house, the presence
of an elderly gentleman calmly perusing a newspaper
on the veranda, inspired Henderson to a typical
excursion in biography. The owner, thinking visitors
impended, pattered down the steps and stared belligerently
at the car.</p>

<p>“Note the carpet slippers,” remarked Henderson as
the gentleman, satisfied that his privacy was not to be
invaded, returned to his chair. “Here we have Bill
Fielding, one of the most delightful old scoundrels in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
town. Observe his pants—sleeps in ’em to avoid the
fatigue of disrobing. To keep off evil spirits he wears
the first nickel he ever earned on a string around his
neck. He’s the smoothest tax-dodger in America.
His wife starved to death and his three children moved
to California to get as far away from the old skunk
as possible. Why does he live in a house like that?
Bless your simple soul, he took it on a mortgage and
camps in two rooms while he waits for a buyer.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe I’d like him! If you’ve got many
such birds I’d better try another town,” laughed Bruce
as Henderson started the car.</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t worry! He’s the last of his school. Now
we’re approaching a different proposition—one that
baffles even my acute analytical powers.”</p>

<p>He drew up before a handsome Georgian house that
stood lengthwise to the street in a broad lot in which
a dozen towering forest trees had been preserved when
the land was subdivided. There were no frivolous
lines in this residence, Bruce noted, surveying it with a
professional eye; it was beyond criticism in its fidelity
to type. The many windows were protected by awnings
of deep orange and the ledges were adorned with
boxes of flowers. The general effect was one of perfect
order and uniformity. Bruce, with his interest in
houses as an expression of the character of their owners
whetted by Henderson’s slangy lectures before other
establishments, turned expectantly to his friend.</p>

<p>“Wind up the machine and put on the record! That’s
a sound piece of architecture, anyhow, and I can see
that you are dying to turn out the skeletons.”</p>

<p>“Painful as it is for me to confess it, the truth is
that in this case I can only present a few bald facts
and leave you to make your own deductions.” Henderson
lighted a fresh cigarette and drew a deep draught<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
of smoke into his lungs. “Franklin Mills,” he said,
and crossed his legs. “Mills is around fifty, maybe a
shade more. The first of the tribe settled here in 1820
and Frank is the fourth of the name. The family
always had money and this bird’s father never lost a
cent in his life. Now Frank’s rich—nothing spectacular,
but recognized as a rich man. His pop left him
well fixed and he’s piled up considerable mazuma on
his own hook. Does this interest you?”</p>

<p>“You always interest me, Bud; please proceed.”</p>

<p>“Well, you might call Franklin Mills the original
man who couldn’t lose. No active business now, but
he controls a couple of banks and a trust company without
figuring in the picture at all, and he set his son up
in a storage battery plant and is a silent factor in a
dozen other flourishing contributors to the smoke
nuisance. Nice chap, by the way, Shep Mills; pleasant
little cuss. Franklin Mills isn’t one of the up-from-the-office-boy
type nor the familiar variety of feverish
business man; velvet glove stuff. Do you follow me?
Only human touch I’ve discovered in this house is the
billiard room, and Mills is a shark at the sport. I’ve
poked the ivories with him now and then just for the
fun of watching him play. His style of playing is a
sort of clue to his character—cool, deliberate, never
misses. One thing, though, I’ve never been able to
figure out: once in a while he makes a wild shot, unnecessarily
and with malice aforethought, as though to
spite himself. If you’d tell Franklin Mills he’d lost his
last cent he wouldn’t blink an eye, but before you got
out of the room he’d have thought up a scheme for
making it all back.”</p>

<p>“A business genius,” commented Bruce, who had
missed no word of Henderson’s sketch. “I can’t say
your snapshot’s very alluring.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>“Oh, I may be wrong! If you’d ask anybody else
about him you’d hear that he’s a leading citizen and a
cultivated gentleman, which he is! While of our city’s
back-number or paralytic group, he’s far from being
ripe for the mortician. One sees him around socially
now and then—on occasions when our real nobility
shake the moth balls from their dress suits. And
that’s characteristic; he has the pride, you might say,
of his long connection with the town. If it’s necessary
for somebody to bunk a distinguished visitor,
Frank Mills opens his door—not that he’s keen to get
his name in the village sheet, but he likes for the town
to make a good impression—sort of ‘I am a citizen
of no mean city,’ like St. Paul or whoever the bird
was that said it first. I doubt if the visitors enjoy his
entertainments, but they’re probably used to being bored
by the gloomy rich.”</p>

<p>“There are other children, perhaps? A house like
that rather suggests a big family,” Bruce remarked.</p>

<p>“The size only indicates Frank’s pride. He’s given
only two hostages to fortune. There’s Leila, the daughter.
There must have been a naughty little devil in
some of the Mills or Shepherd tribe away back yonder,
for that girl certainly is a lively little filly. Shep, who
is named for his mother’s people, never browsed in
the wild-oat fields, but Leila makes up for it. Bounced
from seven boarding schools—holds the champeen
record there. Her mother passed hence when Leila
was about fourteen, and various aunts took a hand in
bringing the kid up, but all they got for their trouble
was nervous prostration. Frank’s crazy about her—old
stuff of doting father bullied by adorable daughter.”</p>

<p>“I think I get the picture,” said Bruce soberly as his
thoughts caught up and played upon this summary of
the history of Franklin Mills.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>Glancing back at the house as Henderson drove away,
Bruce was aware of the irony of his very presence in
the town, sent there by the whim of a dying woman
to be prepared to aid a man who in no imaginable circumstances
could ever require any help it might be in
his power to give. His mother had said that she had
kept some track of Mills’s life; she could never have
realized that he was so secure from any possibility
of need. As Bruce thought of it, Henderson had not
limned an attractive portrait. Only Mills’s devotion
to the daughter, whom Henderson had described in
terms that did not conceal his own admiration for the
girl, brightened the picture.</p>

<p>“What can such a man do with his time in a town
like this?” asked Bruce meditatively. “No active business,
you say. Shooting billiards and cutting coupons
hardly makes an exciting day.”</p>

<p>“Well,” Henderson replied, “I’ve seen him on the
golf links—usually alone or with the club professional.
Frank’s not one of these ha-ha boys who get together
after the game with a few good sports and sneak a
bottle of unlawful Scotch from the locker. Travels a
bit; several times a year he beats it somewhere with
Leila. Shep’s wife bores him, I think; and Shep’s not
exciting; too damned nice. From all I can see, Leila’s
her pop’s single big bet. Some say he’s diffident; others
hold that he’s merely a selfish proposition. He’s missed
a number of chances to marry again—some of the
most dashing widows in our tall corn cities have made
a play for him; but he follows G. Washington’s advice
and keeps clear of entangling alliances.”</p>

<p>“Interesting personality,” said Bruce carelessly. But
Mills had fixed himself in his mind—he had even fashioned
a physical embodiment for the traits Henderson
had described. On the whole, Bruce’s dominant feeling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
was one of relief and satisfaction. Franklin Mills
was as remote from him as though they were creatures
of different planets, separated by vast abysses of time
and space.</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>In spite of Henderson’s sweeping declaration that
he needn’t waste time calling on architects, that Freeman
would take care of him, Bruce spent the next
morning visiting the offices of the architects on his
list. Several of these were out of town; the others
received him amiably; one of them promised him some
work a little later, but was rather vague about it. When
he returned to the hotel at noon he found Henderson
waiting for him. He had nothing to do, he declared,
but to keep Bruce amused. Everything was a little
incidental with Henderson, but he seemed to get what
he wanted without effort, even buyers for the Plantagenet.
Bruce related the results of his visits to the
offices of the architects and Henderson pursed his lips
and emitted a cluck of disapproval.</p>

<p>“Next time mind your Uncle Dudley. Bill Freeman’s
the bird for you. You just leave every little
thing to me. Now what else is troubling you?”</p>

<p>“Well, I want a place to live; not too expensive,
but a few of the minor comforts.”</p>

<p>Two hours later Bruce was signing the lease for a
small bachelor apartment that Henderson had found
for him with, apparently, no effort. He had also persuaded
some friends of his who lived across the street
to give the young architect breakfast and provide a
colored woman to keep his place in order.</p>

<p>Henderson’s acquaintance with his fellow citizens
appeared to be unlimited. He took Bruce to the State<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
House to call on the Governor—brought that official
from a conference from which he emerged good-naturedly
to shake hands and hear a new story. From
this interruption of affairs of state Henderson convoyed
Bruce to a barber shop in the midst of an office
building where there was a venerable negro workman
who told a story about a mule which Henderson said
was the funniest story in the world. The trimming
of a prominent citizen’s hair was somewhat delayed
by the telling of the yarn, but he, like everyone else,
seemed to be tolerant of Henderson’s idiosyncrasies;
and the aged barber’s story was unquestionably a masterpiece.
Henderson began telephoning acquaintances
who had offices in the building to come forthwith to
meet an old college friend. When two men actually
appeared—one an investment broker and the other a
middle-aged lawyer—Henderson organized a quartette
and proceeded to “get harmony.” Neighboring tenants
assembled, attracted by the unwonted sounds, and
Henderson introduced Bruce to them as a new man
in town who was entitled to the highest consideration.</p>

<p>“This is a sociable sort of village,” he said as they
left the shop. “I could see you made a hit with those
fellows. You’re bound to get on, my son.”</p>

<p>At noon on Saturday Henderson drove Bruce to the
Freemans’, where with the utmost serenity he exercised
all the rights of proprietorship. The house, of the
Dutch Colonial type, was on the river in a five-acre tract.
A real estate operator had given Freeman the site with
the stipulation that he build himself a home to establish
a social and artistic standard for the neighborhood.</p>

<p>“Don’t be afraid of these people,” remarked Henderson
reassuringly. “Take your cue from me and
act as though you had a deed for the house in your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
pocket. Bill’s a dreamy sort of cuss, but Dale’s a
human dynamo. She looks fierce, but responds to
kind treatment.”</p>

<p>Bruce never knew when Henderson was serious,
and when a diminutive young lady ran downstairs
whistling he assumed that he was about to be introduced
to the daughter of the house.</p>

<p>“Dale, this is old Bruce Storrs, one of the meanest
men out of jail. I know you’ll hate each other; that’s
why I brought him. At the first sign of any flirtation
between you two I’ll run you both through the meat
chopper and take a high dive into the adjacent stream.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Freeman was absurdly small and slight, and
the short skirt of her simple linen dress and her bobbed
hair exaggerated her diminutive stature. Having
gathered from Henderson an idea that Mrs. Freeman
was an assertive masculine person, Bruce was taken
aback as the little woman smiled up at him and shook
hands.</p>

<p>“It really isn’t my fault that I broke in,” he protested.
“It was this awful Henderson person who told
me you’d be heart-broken if I didn’t come.”</p>

<p>“I should have been! He’d have come alone and
bored me to death. How is every little thing, Bud?”</p>

<p>“Soaring!” mumbled Henderson, who had chosen a
book from the rack on the table and, sprawling on a
couch, became immediately absorbed in it.</p>

<p>“That’s the way Bud shows his noble breeding,” remarked
Mrs. Freeman, “but he is an easy guest to
entertain. I suppose you’re used to him?”</p>

<p>“Oh, we lived together for a couple of years! Nothing
he does astonishes me.”</p>

<p>“Then I needn’t apologize for him. Bud’s an acquired
taste, but once you know him, he’s highly
diverting.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>“When I began rooming with him in Boston I
thought he wasn’t all there, but finally decided he was
at least three-quarters sane.”</p>

<p>“One thing’s certain; he’s mastered the art of not
being bored, which is some accomplishment!” said
Mrs. Freeman, as Henderson rose suddenly and disappeared
in the direction of the kitchen, whence proceeded
presently a sound as of cracking ice.</p>

<p>Mrs. Freeman had something of Henderson’s air
of taking things for granted, and she talked to Bruce
quite as though he were an old friend. She spoke
amusingly of the embarrassments of housekeeping in
the new quarter; they were pioneers, she said, and as
servants refused to bury themselves so far from the
bright lights, she did most of her own housework,
which was lots of fun when you had everything electric
to play with. There was an old colored man who did
chores and helped in the kitchen. She told several
stories to illustrate his proneness to error and his ingenuity
in excusing his mistakes.</p>

<p>“You’ve never lived here? Bud gave me that idea,
but you never know when he’s telling the truth.”</p>

<p>“I never saw the town before, but I hope to stay.”</p>

<p>“It’s up to us to make you want to stay,” she said
graciously.</p>

<p>She had settled herself in the largest chair in the
room, sitting on one foot like a child. She smoked a
cigarette as she talked, one arm thrown back of her
head. She tactfully led Bruce to talk of himself and
when he spoke of his year-long tramp her eyes narrowed
as she gave him a more careful inspection.</p>

<p>“That sounds like a jolly lark. I want to know more
about it, but we must wait for Bill. It’s the sort of
thing he’d adore doing.”</p>

<p>Freeman appeared a moment later. He had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
cleaning up after a morning’s work in the garden. He
was thirty-five, short and burly, with a thick shock of
unruly chestnut hair over which he passed his hand
frequently, smoothing it only to ruffle it again. He
greeted Bruce cordially and began talking of the Tech
and men he assumed Bruce might have known there.
He produced pipe and tobacco from the pockets of his
white flannel trousers and smoked fitfully. Mrs. Freeman
answered the telephone several times and reappeared
to report the messages. One had to do with
changes in a house already under construction. Freeman
began explaining to his wife the impossibility of
meeting the client’s wishes; the matter had been definitely
settled before the letting of the contract and it
would be expensive to alter the plans now. He appealed
to Bruce for support; people might be sane
about everything else in the world, but they became
maddeningly unreasonable when they began building
houses.</p>

<p>“Oh, you’d better fix it for them, Bill,” advised Mrs.
Freeman quietly. “They pay the bills; and I’m not
sure but you were wrong in holding out against them
in the first place.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, if you say so, Dale!” and Freeman resumed
his talk.</p>

<p>Henderson reappeared wearing an apron and bearing
a tray with a cocktail-shaker and four glasses.</p>

<p>“Don’t flinch, Bill,” he said; “it’s my gin. You
pay for the oranges. I say, Dale, I told Tuck to peel
some potatoes. And you wanted those chops for lunch,
didn’t you? There’s nothing else in the icebox and I
told Tuck to put ’em on.”</p>

<p>“He’ll probably ruin them,” said Mrs. Freeman.
“Excuse me, Mr. Storrs, while I get some work out
of Bud.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>It was some time before Bruce got accustomed to
Freeman’s oddities. He was constantly moving about
with a quick, catlike step; or, if he sat down, his hands
were never quiet. But he talked well, proved himself
a good listener, and expressed approval by slapping
his knee when Bruce made some remark that squared
with his own views. He was pleased in a frank, boyish
way when Bruce praised some of his houses which
Henderson had pointed out.</p>

<p>“Yes; clients didn’t bother me; I had my own way
in those cases. I’ve got some plans under way now
that I want to show you. Dale said you were thinking
of starting in here. Well, I need some help right
away. My assistant is leaving me—going to Seattle.
Suppose you drop in Monday. We might be able to
fix up something.”</p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>There was tennis in the afternoon and in the evening
visitors began to drop in—chiefly young married people
of the Freemans’ circle. Some of these were of well-to-do
families and others, Henderson explained to
Bruce, were not rich but “right.” The talk was lively
and pitched in that chaffing key which is possible only
among people who are intimately acquainted. This
was Dale Freeman’s salon, Henderson explained. Any
Saturday or Sunday evening you were likely to meet
people who had something worth while to offer.</p>

<p>He drew Bruce from one group to another, praising
or abusing him with equal extravagance. He assured
everyone that it was a great honor to meet a man
destined, as he declared Bruce to be, to cut a big
figure in the future of the town. He never backed a
dead one, he reminded them. Bruce was the dearest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
friend he had in the world, and, he would ruefully add,
probably the only one. It was for this reason that he
had urged the young architect to establish himself in
the city—a city that sorely needed men of Bruce’s
splendid character and lofty ideals.</p>

<p>A number of the guests had gone when late in the
evening the depleted company was reinforced by the
arrival of Shepherd Mills and his wife.</p>

<p>“Shep and the Shepherdess!” Henderson cheerfully
announced as he ushered them in.</p>

<p>Mrs. Mills extended her hand with a gracious smile
as Bruce was presented. She was tall and fair and
moved with a lazy sort of grace. She spoke in a low,
murmurous tone little broken by inflections. Bruce
noted that she was dressed rather more smartly than
the other women present. It seemed to him that the
atmosphere of the room changed perceptibly on her
appearance; or it might have been merely that everyone
paused a minute to inspect her or to hear what
she had to say. Bruce surmised from the self-conscious
look in her handsome gray eyes as she crossed
the room that she enjoyed being the center of attention.</p>

<p>“Shep just would spend the day motoring to some
queer place,” she was saying, “where a lot of people
were killed by the Indians ages ago. Most depressing!
Ruined the day for me! He’s going to set up
a monument or something to mark the painful affair.”</p>

<p>Shepherd Mills greeted Bruce in the quick, eager
fashion of a diffident person anxious to appear cordial
but not sure that his good intentions will be understood,
and suggested that they sit down. He was not
so tall as his wife; his face was long and rather
delicate. His slight reddish mustache seemed out of
place on his lip; it did not quite succeed in giving him
a masculine air. His speech was marked by odd,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
abrupt pauses, as though he were trying to hide a
stammer; or it might have been that he was merely
waiting to note the effect of what he was saying upon
the hearer. He drew out a case and offered Bruce a
cigarette, lighted one himself, smoking as though it
were part of a required social routine to which he conformed
perforce but did not relish particularly.</p>

<p>There was to be a tennis tournament at the country
club the coming week and he mentioned this tentatively
and was embarrassed to find that Bruce knew nothing
about it.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m always forgetting that everyone doesn’t
live here!” he laughed apologetically. “A little weakness
of the provincial mind! I suppose we’re horribly
provincial out here. Do we strike you that way, Mr.
Storrs?”</p>

<p>One might have surmised from his tone that he was
used to having his serious questions ignored or answered
flippantly, but hoped that the stranger would
meet him on his own ground.</p>

<p>“Oh, there isn’t any such thing as provincialism any
more, is there?” asked Bruce amiably. “I haven’t
sniffed anything of the sort in your city: you seem
very metropolitan. The fact is, I’m a good deal of a
hick myself!”</p>

<p>Mills laughed with more fervor than the remark
justified. Evidently satisfied of the intelligence and
good nature of the Freemans’ guest, he began to discuss
the effect upon industry of a pending coal strike.</p>

<p>His hand went frequently to his mustache as he
talked and the leg that he swung over his knee waggled
nervously. He plunged into a discussion of labor,
mentioning foreign market conditions and citing figures
from trade journals showing the losses to both<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
capital and labor caused by the frequent disturbances
in the industrial world. He expressed opinions tentatively,
a little apologetically, and withdrew them
quickly when they were questioned. Bruce, having
tramped through one of the coal fields where a strike
was in progress, described the conditions as he had
observed them. Mills expressed the greatest interest;
the frown deepened on his face as he listened.</p>

<p>“That’s bad; things shouldn’t be that way,” he said.
“The truth of the matter is that we haven’t mastered
the handling of business. It’s stupendous; we’ve outgrown
the old methods. We forget the vast territory
we have to handle and the numbers of men it’s necessary
to keep in touch with. When my Grandfather
Mills set up as a manufacturer here he had fifty men
working for him, and he knew them all—knew their
families, circumstances, everything. Now I have six
hundred in my battery plant and don’t know fifty of
them! But I’d like to know them all; I feel that it’s
my duty to know them.”</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders impatiently when Henderson’s
sharp little laugh at the other end of the room
broke in discordantly upon Bruce’s sympathetic reply
to this.</p>

<p>“Bud, how silly you are!” they heard Mrs. Mills
saying. “But I don’t know what we’d do without you.
You do cheer things up a bit now and then!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Freeman effected a redistribution of the guests
that brought Mrs. Mills and Bruce together.</p>

<p>“Shep, you mustn’t monopolize Mr. Storrs. Give
Connie a chance. Mr. Storrs is an ideal subject for
you, Connie. Take him out on the terrace and put
him through all your degrees.” And then to Bruce:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
“Mrs. Mills is not only our leading vamp but a terrible
highbrow—reads all the queer stuff!”</p>

<p>Shepherd Mills was not wholly successful in concealing
his displeasure in thus being deprived of
Bruce’s company. And noting this, Bruce put out his
hand, saying:</p>

<p>“That’s a deep subject; we shall have to tackle it
again. Please don’t forget that we’ve left it in the
air and give me another chance.”</p>

<p>“My husband really wants so much to save the human
race,” remarked Mrs. Mills as she stepped out
on the tiled flooring of a broad terrace where there
were rugs and comfortable places to sit. There was
moonlight and the great phalanx of stars marched
across the clear heavens; below flowed the river. She
seated herself on a couch, suffered him to adjust a
pillow at her back and indicated that he was to sit
beside her.</p>

<p>“I’m really done up by our all-day motor trip, but
my husband insisted on dropping in here. The Freemans
are a great resource to all of us. You’re always
likely to find someone new and interesting here. Dale
Freeman has a genius for picking up just the right
sort of people and she’s generous about letting her
friends know them. Are you and the Freemans old
friends?”</p>

<p>“Oh, not at all! Bud Henderson’s my only friend
here. He vouched for me to the Freemans.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Bud! He’s such a delightful rascal. You
don’t mind my calling him that? I shouldn’t if I
weren’t so fond of him. He’s absolutely necessary to
our social existence. We’d stagnate without him.”</p>

<p>“Bud was always a master hand at stirring things
up. His methods are a little peculiar at times, but he
does get results.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>“There’s no question but that he’s a warm admirer
of yours.”</p>

<p>“That’s because he’s forgotten about me! He hadn’t
seen me for five years.”</p>

<p>“I think possibly I can understand that one wouldn’t
exactly forget you, Mr. Storrs.”</p>

<p>She let the words fall carelessly, as though to minimize
their daring in case they were not wholly acceptable
to her auditor. The point was not lost upon him.
He was not without his experience in the gentle art
of flirtation, and her technic was familiar. There was
always, however, the possibility of variations in the
ancient game, and he hoped that Mrs. Shepherd Mills
was blessed with originality.</p>

<p>“There’s a good deal of me to forget; I’m six feet
two!”</p>

<p>“Well, of course I wasn’t referring altogether to
your size,” she said with her murmurous little laugh.
“I adore big men, and I suppose that’s why I married
a small one. Isn’t’ it deliciously funny how contrary
we are when it comes to the important affairs of our
lives! I suppose it’s just because we’re poor, weak
humans. We haven’t the courage of our prejudices.”</p>

<p>“I’d never thought of that,” Bruce replied. “But it
is an interesting idea. I suppose we’re none of us
free agents. It’s not in the great design of things that
we shall walk a chalk line. If we all did, it would
probably be a very stupid world.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad you feel that way about it. For a long
time half the world tried to make conformists of the
other half; nowadays not more than a third are trying
to keep the rest on the chalk line—and that third’s
skidding! People think me dreadfully heretical about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
everything. But—I’m not, really! Tell me you don’t
think me terribly wild and untamed.”</p>

<p>“I think,” said Bruce, feeling that here was a cue
he mustn’t miss, “I think you are very charming. If
it’s your ideas that make you so, I certainly refuse to
quarrel with them.”</p>

<p>“How beautifully you came up on that! Something
tells me that I’m not going to be disappointed in you.
I have a vague sort of idea that we’re going to understand
each other.”</p>

<p>“You do me great honor! It will be a grief to me
if we don’t.”</p>

<p>“It’s odd how instantly we recognize the signals
when someone really worth while swims into our ken,”
she said pensively. “Dear old Nature looks after that!
Bud intimated that you’re to be one of us; throw in
your lot with those of us who struggle along in this
rather nice, comfortable town. If you enjoy grandeur
in social things, you’ll not find much here to interest
you; but if just nice little companies and a few friends
are enough, you can probably keep amused.”</p>

<p>“If the Freemans’ friends are specimens and there’s
much of this sort of thing”—he waved his hand toward
the company within—“I certainly shall have nothing to
complain of.”</p>

<p>“We must see you at our house. I haven’t quite
Dale’s knack of attracting people”—she paused a moment
upon this note of humility—“but I try to bring a
few worth while people together. I’ve educated a few
men to drop in for tea on Thursdays with usually a
few of my pals among the young matrons and a girl
or two. If you feel moved——”</p>

<p>“I hope you’re not trifling with me,” said Bruce,
“for I shall certainly come.”</p>

<p>“Then that’s all settled. Don’t pay any attention to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
what Bud says about me. To hear him talk you might
think me a man-eater. My husband’s the dearest thing!
He doesn’t mind at all my having men in for tea. He
comes himself now and then when his business doesn’t
interfere. Dear Shep! He’s a slave to business, and
he’s always at work on some philanthropic scheme. I
just talk about helping the world; but he, poor dear,
really tries to do something.”</p>

<p>Henderson appeared presently with a dark hint that
Shepherd was peeved by their long absence and that
the company was breaking up.</p>

<p>“Connie never plays all her cards the first time,
Bruce; you must give her another chance.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Mr. Storrs has promised me a thousand
chances!” said Mrs. Mills.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER THREE</h2>
</div>


<h3>I</h3>

<p>Sunday evening the Freemans were called unexpectedly
into town and Bruce and Henderson were left
to amuse themselves. Henderson immediately lost himself
in a book and Bruce, a little homesick for the old
freedom of the road, set out for a walk. A footpath
that followed the river invited him and he lounged
along, his spirit responding to the beauty of the night,
his mind intent upon the future. The cordiality of the
Freemans and their circle had impressed him with the
friendliness of the community. It would take time to
establish himself in his profession, but he had confidence
in his power to achieve; the lust for work was
already strong in him. He was satisfied that he had
done wisely in obeying his mother’s mandate; he would
never have been happy if he had ignored it.</p>

<p>His meeting with Shepherd Mills had roused no
resentment, revived no such morbid thoughts as had
troubled him on the night of his arrival in town.
Shepherd Mills was his half-brother; this, to be sure,
was rather staggering; but his reaction to the meeting
was void of bitterness. He speculated a good deal
about young Mills. The gentleness and forbearance
with which he suffered the raillery of his intimates, his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
anxiety to be accounted a good fellow, his serious interest
in matters of real importance—in all these things
there was something touching and appealing. It was
difficult to correlate Shepherd with his wife, but perhaps
their dissimilarities were only superficial. Bruce
appraised Connie Mills as rather shallow, fond of admiration,
given to harmless poses in which her friends
evidently encouraged and indulged her. She practiced
her little coquetries with an openness that was in itself
a safeguard. As they left the Freemans, Shepherd and
his wife had repeated their hope of seeing him again.
It was bewildering, but it had come about so naturally
that there seemed nothing extraordinary in the fact
that he was already acquainted with members of Franklin
Mills’s family....</p>

<p>Bruce paused now and then where the path drew in
close to the river to look down at the moonlit water
through the fringe of trees and shrubbery. A boy and
girl floated by in a canoe, the girl singing as she
thrummed a ukulele, and his eyes followed them a little
wistfully. Farther on the dull put-put-put of a motor-boat
broke the silence. The sound ceased abruptly,
followed instantly by a colloquy between the occupants.</p>

<p>“Damn this fool thing!” ejaculated a feminine voice.
“We’re stuck!”</p>

<p>“I had noticed it!” said another girl’s voice good
naturedly. “But such is the life of the sailor. I
wouldn’t just choose this for an all-night camp!”</p>

<p>“Don’t be so sweet about it, Millicent! I’d like to
sink this boat.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t Polly’s fault. She’s already half-buried in
the sand,” laughed the other.</p>

<p>Bruce scrambled down to the water’s edge and
peered out upon the river. A small power boat had
grounded on a sandbar in the middle of the stream.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
Its occupants were two young women in bathing suits.
But for their voices he would have taken them for
boys. One was tinkering with the engine while the
other was trying to push off the boat with an oar
which sank ineffectually in the sand. In their attempts
to float their craft the young women had not seen
Bruce, who, satisfied that they were in no danger, was
rather amused by their plight. They were presumably
from one of the near-by villas and their bathing suits
implied familiarity with the water. The girl at the
engine talked excitedly with an occasional profane outburst;
her companion was disposed to accept the situation
philosophically.</p>

<p>“We can easily swim out, so don’t get so excited,
Leila,” said the girl with the oar. “And do stop
swearing; voices travel a long way over the water.”</p>

<p>“I don’t care who hears me,” said the other, though
in a lower tone.</p>

<p>She gave the engine a spin, starting the motor, but
the power was unequal to the task of freeing the boat.
With an exclamation of disgust she turned off the
switch and the futile threshing of the propeller ceased.</p>

<p>“Let’s swim ashore and send back for Polly,” said
the girl addressed as Millicent.</p>

<p>“I see myself swimming out!” the other retorted.
“I’m not going to leave Polly here for some pirate to
steal.”</p>

<p>“Nobody’s going to steal her. This isn’t the ocean,
you know.”</p>

<p>“Well, no fool boat’s going to get the best of me!
Where’s that flask? I’m freezing!”</p>

<p>“You don’t need any more of that! Please give it
to me!”</p>

<p>“I hope you are enjoying yourself,” said the other
petulantly. “I don’t see any fun in this!”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>“Hello, there!” called Bruce, waving his arms to
attract their attention. “Can I be of help?”</p>

<p>Startled by his voice, they did not reply immediately,
but he heard them conferring as to this unlooked-for
hail from the bank.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m perfectly harmless!” he cried reassuringly.
“I was just passing and heard your engine. If there’s
a boat near by I can pull you off, or I’ll swim out and
lift your boat off if you say so.”</p>

<p>“Better get a boat,” said the voice he had identified
with the name of Millicent. “There’s a boathouse just
a little farther up, on your side. You’ll find a skiff
and a canoe. We’ll be awfully glad to have your help.
Thank you ever so much!”</p>

<p>“Don’t forget to come back,” cried Leila.</p>

<p>“Certainly not!” laughed Bruce and sprang up the
bank.</p>

<p>He found the boathouse without trouble, chose the
skiff as easier to manage, and rowed back. In the
moonlight he saw Millicent standing up in the launch
watching him, and as he approached she flashed an
electric torch along the side of the boat that he might
see the nature of their difficulty.</p>

<p>“Do you need food or medical attention?” he asked
cheerfully as he skillfully maneuvered the skiff and
grounded it on the sand.</p>

<p>“I think we’d better get out,” she said.</p>

<p>“No; stay right there till I see what I can do. I
think I can push you off. All steady now!”</p>

<p>The launch moved a little at his first attempt to dislodge
it and a second strong shove sent it into the
channel.</p>

<p>“Now start your engine!” he commanded.</p>

<p>The girl in the middle of the boat muttered something
he didn’t catch.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>“Leila, can you start the engine?” demanded Millicent.
“I think—I think I’ll have to row back,” she
said when Leila made no response. “My friend isn’t
feeling well.”</p>

<p>“I’ll tow you—that’s easy,” said Bruce, noting that
her companion apparently was no longer interested in
the proceedings. “Please throw me your rope!”</p>

<p>He caught the rope and fastened it to the stern of
the skiff and called out that he was ready.</p>

<p>“Please land us where you found the boat,” said
Millicent. She settled herself in the stern of the launch
and took the tiller. No word was spoken till they
reached the boathouse.</p>

<p>“That’s all you can do,” said Millicent, who had
drawn on a long bath wrapper and stepped out. “And
thank you very, very much; I’m sorry to have caused
you so much trouble.”</p>

<p>This was clearly a dismissal, but he loosened the rope
and tied up the skiff. He waited, holding the launch,
while Millicent tried to persuade Leila to disembark.</p>

<p>“Perhaps——” began Bruce, and hesitated. It
seemed unfair to leave the girl alone with the problem
of getting her friend ashore. Not to put too fine
a point on the matter, Leila was intoxicated.</p>

<p>“Now, Leila!” cried Millicent exasperatedly. “You’re
making yourself ridiculous, besides keeping this gentleman
waiting. It’s not a bit nice of you!”</p>

<p>“Jus’ restin’ lil bit,” said Leila indifferently. “I’m
jus’ restin’ and I’m not goin’ to leave Polly. I should
shay not!”</p>

<p>And in assertion of her independence she began to
whistle. She seemed greatly amused that her attempts
to whistle were unsuccessful.</p>

<p>Millicent turned to Bruce. “If I could get her out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
of the boat I could put her in our car and take her
home.”</p>

<p>“Surely!” he said and bent over quickly and lifted
the girl from the launch, set her on her feet and
steadied her. Millicent fumbled in the launch, found
a bath wrapper and flung it about Leila’s shoulders.
She guided her friend toward the long, low boathouse
and turned a switch.</p>

<p>“I can manage now,” she said, gravely surveying
Bruce in the glare of light. “I’m so sorry to have
troubled you.”</p>

<p>She was tall and fair with markedly handsome brown
eyes and a great wealth of fine-spun golden hair that
escaped from her bathing cap and tumbled down upon
her shoulders. Her dignity was in nowise diminished
by her garb. She betrayed no agitation. Bruce felt
that she was paying him the compliment of assuming
that she was dealing with a gentleman who, having performed
a service, would go his way and forget the
whole affair. She drew her arm about the now passive
Leila, who was much shorter—quite small, indeed, in
comparison.</p>

<p>“Our car’s here and we’ll get dressed and drive back
into town. Thank you so much and—good-night!”</p>

<p>“I was glad to help you;—good-night!”</p>

<p>The door closed upon them. Bruce made the launch
fast to the landing and resumed his walk.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>When he returned to the Freemans, Henderson flung
aside his book and complained of Bruce’s prolonged
absence. “I had begun to think you’d got yourself
kidnapped. Go ahead and talk,” he said, yawning and
stretching himself.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>“Well, I’ve had a mild adventure,” said Bruce, lighting
a cigarette; and he described his meeting with the
two young women.</p>

<p>“Not so bad!” remarked Henderson placidly. “Such
little adventures never happen to me. The incident
would make good first page stuff for a newspaper; society
girls shipwrecked. You ought to have taken the
flask as a souvenir. Leila is an obstreperous little kid;
she really ought to behave herself. Right the first time.
Leila Mills, of course; I think I mentioned her the
other day. Her friend is Millicent Harden. Guess I
omitted Millicent in my review of our citizens. Quite
a remarkable person. She plays the rôle of big sister
to Leila; they’re neighbors on Jefferson Avenue. That’s
just a boathouse on the Styx that Mills built for Leila’s
delectation. She pulls a cocktail tea there occasionally.
Millicent’s pop made a fortune out of an asthma cure—the
joy of all cut-rate druggists. Not viewed with
approval by medical societies. Socially the senior
Hardens are outside the breastworks, but Millicent is
asked to very large functions, where nobody knows
who’s there. They live in that whopping big house
just north of the Mills place, and old Doc Harden gives
Millicent everything she wants. Hence a grand organ,
and the girl is a regular Cecelia at the keys. Really
plays. Strong artistic bent. We can’t account for
people like the Hardens having such a daughter.
There’s a Celtic streak in the girl, I surmise—that odd
sort of poetic strain that’s so beguiling in the Irish.
She models quite wonderfully, they tell me. Well,
well! So you were our little hero on the spot!”</p>

<p>“But Leila?” said Bruce seriously. “You don’t
quite expect to find the daughter of a prominent citizen
tipsy on a river, and rather profane at that.”</p>

<p>“Oh, thunder!” exclaimed Henderson easily. “Leila’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
all right. You needn’t worry about her. She’s merely
passing through a phase and will probably emerge
safely. Leila’s hardly up to your standard, but Millicent
is a girl you’ll like. I ought to have told Dale to
ask Millicent here. Dale’s a broad-minded woman and
doesn’t mind it at all that old Harden’s rolled up a
million by being smart enough to scamper just a nose
length ahead of the Federal grand jury carrying his
rotten dope in triumph.”</p>

<p>“Miss Mills, I suppose, is an acceptable member of
the Freemans’ group?” Bruce inquired.</p>

<p>“Acceptable enough, but this is all too tame for Leila.
Curious sort of friendship—Leila and Millicent. Socially
Millicent is, in a manner of speaking, between the
devil and the deep sea. She’s just a little too superior
to train with the girls of the Longview Country Club
set and the asthma cure keeps her from being chummy
with the Faraway gang. But I’ll say that Leila’s lucky
to have a friend like Millicent.”</p>

<p>“Um—yes,” Bruce assented. “I’m beginning to see
that your social life here has a real flavor.”</p>

<p>“Well, it’s not all just plain vanilla,” Bud agreed
with a yawn.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER FOUR</h2>
</div>


<h3>I</h3>

<p>Henderson made his wife’s return an excuse for
giving a party at the Faraway Country Club. Mrs.
Henderson had brought home a trophy from the golf
tournament and her prowess must be celebrated. She
was a tall blonde with a hearty, off-hand manner, and
given to plain, direct speech. She treated Bud as
though he were a younger brother, to be humored to a
certain point and then reminded a little tartly of the
limitations of her tolerance.</p>

<p>When Bruce arrived at the club he found his hostess
and Mrs. Freeman receiving the guests in the hall and
directing them to a dark end of the veranda where
Bud was holding forth with a cocktail-shaker. Obedient
to their hint, he stumbled over the veranda chairs
until he came upon a group of young people gathered
about Bud, who was energetically compounding drinks
as he told a story. Bruce knew the story; it was the
oldest of Bud’s yarns, and his interest wavered to become
fixed immediately upon a girl beside him who
was giving Bud her complete attention. Even in the
dim light of the veranda there was no mistaking her:
she was the Millicent Harden he had rescued from the
sand bar. At the conclusion of the story she joined in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
the general laugh and turned round to find Bruce regarding
her intently.</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon,” he said and bowed gravely.</p>

<p>“Oh, you needn’t!” she replied quickly.</p>

<p>He lifted his head to find her inspecting him with
an amused smile.</p>

<p>“I might find someone to introduce us—Mr. Henderson,
perhaps,” he said. “My name—if the matter is
important—is Bruce Storrs.”</p>

<p>“Possibly we might complete the introduction unassisted—my
name is Millicent Harden!”</p>

<p>“How delightful! Shall we dance?”</p>

<p>After the dance he suggested that they step out for
a breath of air. They found seats and she said immediately:</p>

<p>“Of course I remember you; I’d be ashamed if I
didn’t. I’m glad of this chance to thank you. I know
Leila—Miss Mills—will want to thank you, too. We
must have seemed very silly that night on the river.”</p>

<p>“Such a thing might happen to anyone; why not
forget it?”</p>

<p>“Let me thank you again,” she said seriously. “You
were ever so kind.”</p>

<p>“The incident is closed,” he remarked with finality.
“Am I keeping you from a partner? They’re dancing
again. We might sit this out if I’m not depriving
you——”</p>

<p>“You’re not. It’s warm inside and this is a relief.
We might even wander down the lawn and look for
elves and dryads and nymphs. Those big trees and
the stars set the stage for such encounters.”</p>

<p>“It’s rather nice to believe in fairies and such things.
At times I’m a believer; then I lose my faith.”</p>

<p>“We all forget our fairies sometimes,” she answered
gravely.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>He had failed to note at their meeting on the river
the loveliness of her voice. He found himself waiting
for the recurrence of certain tones that had a curious
musical resonance. He was struck by a certain gravity
in her that was expressed for fleeting moments in both
voice and eyes. Even with the newest dance music
floating out to them and the light and laughter within,
he was aware of an indefinable quality in the girl that
seemed somehow to translate her to remote and shadowy
times. Her profile—clean-cut without sharpness—and
her manner of wearing her abundant hair—carried
back loosely to a knot low on her head—strengthened
his impression of her as being a little foreign to the
place and hour. She spoke with quiet enthusiasm of
the outdoor sports that interested her—riding she enjoyed
most of all. Henderson had intimated that her
social life was restricted, but she bore herself more
like a young woman of the world than any other girl
he remembered.</p>

<p>“Maybelle Henderson will scold me for hiding you
away,” she said. “But I just can’t dance whenever
the band plays. It’s got to be an inspiration!”</p>

<p>“Then I thank you again for one perfect dance!
I’m afraid I didn’t appreciate what you were giving
me.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I danced with you to hide my embarrassment!”
she laughed.</p>

<p>Half an hour passed and they had touched and dismissed
many subjects when she rose and caught the
hand of a girl who was passing.</p>

<p>“Miss Mills, Mr. Storrs. It’s quite fitting that you
should meet Mr. Storrs.”</p>

<p>“Fitting?” asked the girl, breathless from her dance.</p>

<p>“We’ve all met before—on the river—most shockingly!
You might just say thank you to Mr. Storrs.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>“Oh, this is <i>not</i>——” Leila drew back and inspected
Bruce with a direct, candid gaze.</p>

<p>“Miss Harden is mistaken; this is the first time we
ever met,” declared Bruce.</p>

<p>“Isn’t he nice!” Leila exclaimed. “From what Millie
said I knew you would be like this.” And then: “Oh,
lots of people are bragging about you and promising to
introduce me! Here comes Tommy Barnes; he has this
dance. Oh, Millie! if you get a chance you might say
a kind word to papa. He’s probably terribly bored
by this time.”</p>

<p>“Leila’s a dear child! I’m sure you’ll like her,” said
Millicent as the girl fluttered away. “Oh, I adore this
piece! Will you dance with me?”</p>

<p>As they finished the dance Mrs. Henderson intercepted
them.</p>

<p>“Aren’t you the limit, you two? I’ve had Bud
searching the whole place for you and here you are!
Quite as though you hadn’t been hiding for the last
hour.”</p>

<p>“I’m going to keep Mr. Storrs just a moment longer,”
said Millicent. “Leila said her father was perishing
somewhere and I want Mr. Storrs to meet him.”</p>

<p>“Yes; certainly,” said Bruce.</p>

<p>He walked beside her into the big lounge, where
many of the older guests were gathered.</p>

<p>“Poor Mr. Mills!” said Millicent after a quick survey
of the room. “There he is, listening to one of
Mr. Tasker’s interminable yarns.”</p>

<p>She led the way toward a group of men, one of
whom was evidently nearing the end of a long story.
One of his auditors, a dark man of medium height and
rather stockily built, was listening with an air of forced
attention. His grayish hair was brushed smoothly
away from a broad forehead, his neatly trimmed mustache<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
was a trifle grayer than his hair. Millicent and
Bruce fell within the line of his vision, and his face
brightened instantly as he nodded to the girl and
waved his hand. The moment the story was ended he
crossed to them, his eyes bright with pleasure and a
smile on his face.</p>

<p>“I call it a base desertion!” he exclaimed. “Leila
brings me here and coolly parks me. A father gets
mighty little consideration these days!”</p>

<p>“Don’t scold! Mr. Mills—let me present Mr.
Storrs.”</p>

<p>“I’m very glad to meet you, Mr. Storrs,” said Mills
with quiet cordiality. He swept Bruce with a quick,
comprehensive scrutiny.</p>

<p>“Mr. Storrs has lately moved here,” Millicent explained.</p>

<p>“I congratulate you, Mr. Storrs, on having fallen
into good hands.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Miss Harden is taking splendid care of me!”
Bruce replied.</p>

<p>“She’s quite capable of doing that!” Mills returned.</p>

<p>Bruce was studying Franklin Mills guardedly. A
man of reserves and reticences, not a safe subject for
quick judgments. His manner was somewhat listless
now that the introduction had been accomplished; and
perhaps aware of this, he addressed several remarks
to Bruce, asking whether the music was all that the
jazzy age demanded; confessed with mock chagrin
that his dancing days were over.</p>

<p>“You only think they are! Mr. Mills really dances
very well. You’d be surprised, Mr. Storrs, considering
how venerable he is!”</p>

<p>“That’s why I don’t dance!” Mills retorted with a
rueful grin. “‘Considering his age’ is the meanest
phrase that can be applied to a man of fifty.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>Bud Henderson here interrupted them, declaring that
dozens of people were disconsolate because Bruce had
concealed himself.</p>

<p>“Of course you must go!” said Millicent.</p>

<p>“I hope to meet you again,” Mills remarked as Bruce
bowed to him.</p>

<p>“Thank you, Mr. Mills,” said Bruce.</p>

<p>He was conscious once more of Mills’s intent scrutiny.
It seemed to him as he walked away that Mills’s
eyes followed him.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter, old top?” Bud demanded.
“You’re not tired?”</p>

<p>“No; I’m all right,” Bruce replied, though his heart
was pounding hard; and feeling a little giddy, he laid
his hand on Henderson’s arm.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER FIVE</h2>
</div>


<h3>I</h3>

<p>Franklin Mills stood by one of the broad windows
in his private office gazing across the smoky industrial
district of his native city. With his hands thrust into
his trousers’ pockets, he was a picture of negligent
ease. His face was singularly free of the markings
of time. His thick, neatly trimmed hair with its even
intermixture of white added to his look of distinction.
His business suit of dark blue with an obscure green
stripe was evidently a recent creation of his tailor,
and a wing collar with a neatly tied polka-dot cravat
contributed further to the impression he gave of a man
who had a care for his appearance. The gray eyes
that looked out over the city narrowed occasionally as
some object roused his attention—a freight train
crawling on the outskirts or some disturbance in the
street below. Then he would resume his reverie as
though enjoying his sense of immunity from the fret
and jar of the world about him.</p>

<p><i>Bruce Storrs.</i> The name of the young man he had
met at the Country Club lingered disturbingly in his
memory. He had heard someone ask that night where
Storrs came from, and Bud Henderson, his sponsor,
had been ready with the answer, “Laconia, Ohio.”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
Mills had been afraid to ask the question himself.
Long-closed doors swung open slowly along the dim
corridor of memory and phantom shapes emerged—among
them a figure Franklin Mills recognized as himself.
Swiftly he computed the number of years that
had passed since, in his young manhood, he had spent
a summer in the pleasant little town, sent there by his
father to act as auditor of a manufacturing concern
in which Franklin Mills III for a time owned an interest.
Marian Storrs was a lovely young being—vivacious,
daring, already indifferent to the man to
whom she had been married two years.... He had
been a beast to take advantage of her, to accept all that
she had yielded to him with a completeness and passion
that touched him poignantly now as she lived again in
his memory.... Was this young man, Bruce Storrs,
her son? He was a splendid specimen, distinctly handsome,
with the air of breeding that Mills valued. He
turned from the window and walked idly about the
room, only to return to his contemplation of the hazy
distances.</p>

<p>The respect of his fellow man, one could see, meant
much to him. He was Franklin Mills, the fourth of
the name in succession in the Mid-western city, enjoying
an unassailable social position and able to command
more cash at a given moment than any other
man in the community. Nothing was so precious to
Franklin Mills as his peace of mind, and here was a
problem that might forever menace that peace. The
hope that the young man himself knew nothing did
not abate the hateful, hideous question ... was he
John Storrs’s son or his own? Surely Marian Storrs
could not have told the boy of that old episode....</p>

<p>Nearly every piece of property in the city’s original
mile square had at some time belonged to a Mills. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
earlier men of the name had been prominent in public
affairs, but he had never been interested in politics
and he never served on those bothersome committees
that promote noble causes and pursue the public with
subscription papers. When Franklin Mills gave he gave
liberally, but he preferred to make his contributions
unsolicited. It pleased him to be represented at the
State Fair with cattle and saddle horses from Deer
Trail Farm. Like his father and grandfather, he kept
in touch with the soil, and his farm, fifteen miles from
his office, was a show place; his Jersey herd enjoyed a
wide reputation. The farm was as perfectly managed
as his house and office. Its carefully tended fields, his
flocks and herds and the dignified Southern Colonial
house were but another advertisement of his substantial
character and the century-long identification of his
name with the State.</p>

<p>His private office was so furnished as to look as
little as possible like a place for the transaction of
business. There were easy lounging chairs, a long
leathern couch, a bookcase, a taboret with cigars and
cigarettes. The flat-top desk, placed between two windows,
contained nothing but an immaculate blotter
and a silver desk set that evidently enjoyed frequent
burnishing. It was possible for him to come and go
without traversing the other rooms of the suite. Visitors
who passed the office boy’s inspection and satisfied
a prim stenographer that their errands were
not frivolous found themselves in communication with
Arthur Carroll, Mills’s secretary, a young man of
thirty-five, trained as a lawyer, who spoke for his employer
in all matters not demanding decisions of first
importance. Carroll was not only Mills’s confidential
man of business, but when necessary he performed
the duties of social secretary. He was tactful, socially<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
in demand as an eligible bachelor, and endowed with
a genius for collecting information that greatly assisted
Mills in keeping in touch with the affairs of the community.</p>

<p>Mills glanced at his watch and turned to press a
button in a plate on the corner of his desk. Carroll
appeared immediately.</p>

<p>“You said Shep was coming?” Mills inquired.</p>

<p>“Yes; he was to be here at five, but said he might
be a little late.”</p>

<p>Mills nodded, asked a question about the survey of
some land adjoining Deer Trail Farm for which he
was negotiating, and listened attentively while Carroll
described a discrepancy in the boundary lines.</p>

<p>“Is that all that stands in the way?” Mills asked.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Carroll, “Parsons shows signs of bucking.
He’s thought of reasons, sentimental ones, for
not selling. He and his wife moved there when they
were first married and their children were all born on
the place.”</p>

<p>“Of course we have nothing to do with that,” remarked
Mills, slipping an ivory paper knife slowly
through his fingers. “The old man is a failure, and
the whole place is badly run down. I really need it
for pasture.”</p>

<p>“Oh, he’ll sell! We just have to be a little patient,”
Carroll replied.</p>

<p>“All right, but don’t close till the title’s cleared up. I
don’t buy law suits. Come in, Shep.”</p>

<p>Shepherd Mills had appeared at the door during
this talk. His father had merely glanced at him, and
Shepherd waited, hat in hand, his topcoat on his arm,
till the discussion was ended.</p>

<p>“What’s that you’ve got there?” his father asked,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
seating himself in a comfortable chair a little way
from the desk.</p>

<p>In drawing some papers from the pocket of his overcoat,
Shepherd dropped his hat, picked it up and laid
it on the desk. He was trying to appear at ease, and
replied that it was a contract calling for a large order
which the storage battery company had just made.</p>

<p>“We worked a good while to get that,” said the
young man with a ring of pride in his voice. “I
thought you’d like to know it’s all settled.”</p>

<p>Mills put on his glasses, scanned the document with
a practiced eye and handed it back.</p>

<p>“That’s good. You’re running full capacity now?”</p>

<p>“Yes; we’ve got orders enough to keep us going
full handed for several months.”</p>

<p>The young man’s tone was eager; he was clearly
anxious for his father’s approval. He had expected a
little more praise for his success in getting the contract,
but was trying to adjust himself to his father’s
calm acceptance of the matter. He drummed the edge
of the desk as he recited certain figures as to conditions
at the plant. His father disconcertingly corrected
one of his statements.</p>

<p>“Yes; you’re right, father,” Shepherd stammered.
“I got the July figures mixed up with the June report.”</p>

<p>Mills smiled indulgently; took a cigarette from a
silver box on the taboret beside him and unhurriedly
lighted it.</p>

<p>“You and Constance are coming over for dinner tonight?”
he asked. “I think Leila said she’d asked
you.”</p>

<p>His senior’s very calmness seemed to add to Shepherd’s
nervousness. He rose and laid his overcoat on
the couch, drew out his handkerchief and wiped his
forehead, remarking that it was warm for the season.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>“I hadn’t noticed it,” his father remarked in the
tone of one who is indifferent to changes of temperature.</p>

<p>“There’s a little matter I’ve been wanting to speak
to you about,” Shepherd began. “I thought it would
be better to mention it here—you never like talking
business at the house. If it’s going to be done it ought
to be started now, before the bad weather sets in.”</p>

<p>He paused, a little breathless, and Mills said, the
least bit impatiently:</p>

<p>“Do you mean that new unit at the plant? I thought
we’d settled that. I thought you were satisfied you
could get along this winter with the plant as it is.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no! It’s not that!” Shepherd hastily corrected.
“Of course that’s all settled. This is quite a different
matter. I only want to suggest it now so you can
think it over. You see, our employees were all mightily
pleased because you let them have the use of the Milton
farm. There’s quite a settlement grown up around
the plant and the Milton land is so near they can walk
to it. I’ve kept tab this summer and about a hundred
of the men go there Saturday afternoons and Sundays;
mostly married men who take their families. I could
see it made a big difference in the morale of the shop.”</p>

<p>He paused to watch the effect of his statements, but
Mills made no sign. He merely recrossed his legs,
knocked the ash from his cigarette and nodded for his
son to go on.</p>

<p>“I want you to know I appreciate your letting me
use the property that way,” Shepherd resumed. “I
was out there a good deal myself, and those people
certainly enjoyed themselves. Now what’s in my mind
is this, father”—he paused an instant and bent forward
with boyish eagerness—“I’ve heard you say you
didn’t mean to sell any lots in the Milton addition for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
several years—not until the street car line’s extended—and
I thought since the factory’s so close to the farm,
we might build some kind of a clubhouse the people
could use the year round. They can’t get any amusements
without coming into town, and we could build
the house near the south gate of the property, where
our people could get to it easily. They could have
dances and motion pictures, and maybe a few lectures
and some concerts, during the winter. They’ll attend
to all that themselves. Please understand that I don’t
mean this as a permanent thing. The clubhouse needn’t
cost much, so when you get ready to divide the farm
the loss wouldn’t be great. It might even be used in
some way. I just wanted to mention it; we can talk
out the details after you’ve thought it over.”</p>

<p>In his anxiety to make himself clear Shepherd had
stammered repeatedly. He waited, his face flushed,
his eyelids quivering, for some encouraging word from
his father. Mills dropped his cigarette into the tray
before he spoke.</p>

<p>“What would such a house cost, Shep?”</p>

<p>“It can be built for twenty thousand dollars. I got
a young fellow in Freeman’s office to make me some
sketches—Storrs—you met him at the country club;
a mighty nice chap. If you’ll just look at these——”</p>

<p>Mills took the two letter sheets his son extended,
one showing a floor plan, the other a rough sketch of
the proposed building, inspected them indifferently and
gave them back.</p>

<p>“If you’d like to keep them——” Shepherd began.</p>

<p>“No; that isn’t necessary. I think we can settle the
matter now. It was all right for those people to use
the farm as a playground during the summer, but this
idea of building a house for them won’t do. We’ve
got to view these things practically, Shep. You’re<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
letting your sentimental feelings run away with you.
If I let you go ahead with that scheme, it would be
unfair to all the other employers in town. If you
stop to think, you can see for yourself that for us
to build such a clubhouse would cause dissatisfaction
among other concerns I’m interested in. And there’s
another thing. Your people have done considerable
damage—breaking down the shrubbery and young
trees I’d planted where I’d laid out the roads. I hadn’t
spoken of this, for I knew how much fun you got out
of it, but as for spending twenty thousand dollars for
a clubhouse and turning the whole place over to those
people, it can’t be done!”</p>

<p>“Well, father, of course I can see your way of looking
at it,” Shepherd said with a crestfallen air. “I
thought maybe, just for a few years——”</p>

<p>“That’s another point,” Mills interrupted. “You
can’t give it to them and then take it away. Such
people are bound to be unreasonable. Give them an
inch and they take a mile. You’ll find as you grow
older that they have precious little appreciation of such
kindnesses. Your heart’s been playing tricks with your
head. I tell you, my dear boy, there’s nothing in it;
positively nothing!”</p>

<p>Mills rose, struck his hands together smartly and
laid them on his son’s shoulders, looking down at him
with smiling tolerance. Shepherd was nervously fumbling
Storrs’s sketches, and as his father stepped back
he hastily thrust them into his pocket.</p>

<p>“You may be right, father,” he said slowly, and with
no trace of resentment.</p>

<p>“Storrs, you said?” Mills inquired as he opened a
cabinet door and took out his hat and light overcoat.
“Is he the young man Millie introduced me to?”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>“Yes; that tall, fine-looking chap; a Tech man; just
moved here—friend of Bud Henderson’s.”</p>

<p>“I wasn’t quite sure of the name. He’s an architect,
is he?” asked Mills as he slowly buttoned his coat.</p>

<p>“Yes; I met him at the Freemans’ and had him
for lunch at the club. Freeman is keen about him.”</p>

<p>“He’s rather an impressive-looking fellow,” Mills
replied. “Expects to live here, does he?”</p>

<p>“Yes. He has no relatives here; just thought the
town offered a good opening. His home was somewhere
in Ohio, I think.”</p>

<p>“Yes; I believe I heard that,” Mills replied carelessly.
“You have your car with you?”</p>

<p>“Yes; the runabout. I’ll skip home and dress and
drive over with Connie. We’re going to the Claytons’
later.”</p>

<p>When they reached the street Shepherd ordered up
his father’s limousine and saw him into it, and waved
his hand as it rolled away. As he turned to seek
his own car the smile faded from his face. It was
not merely that his father had refused to permit
the building of the clubhouse, but that the matter had
been brushed aside quite as a parent rejects some absurd
proposal of an unreasoning child. He strode
along with the quick steps compelled by his short
stature, smarting under what he believed to be an
injustice, and ashamed of himself for not having combated
the objections his father had raised. The loss
of shrubs or trees was nothing when weighed against
the happiness of the people who had enjoyed the use
of the farm. He thought now of many things that he
might have said in defence of his proposition; but he
had never been able to hold his own in debate with
his father. His face burned with humiliation. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
regretted that within an hour he was to see his father
again.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>The interior of Franklin Mills’s house was not so
forbidding as Henderson had hinted in his talk with
Bruce. It was really a very handsomely furnished,
comfortable establishment that bore the marks of a
sound if rather austere taste. The house had been
built in the last years of Mrs. Mills’s life, and if a
distinctly feminine note was lacking in its appointments,
this was due to changes made by Mills in keeping
with the later tendency in interior decoration
toward the elimination of nonessentials.</p>

<p>It was only a polite pretense that Leila kept house
for her father. Her inclinations were decidedly not
domestic, and Mills employed and directed the servants,
ordered the meals, kept track of expenditures and
household bills, and paid them through his office. He
liked formality and chose well-trained servants capable
of conforming to his wishes in this respect. The
library on the second floor was Mills’s favorite lounging
place. Here were books indicative of the cultivated
and catholic taste of the owner, and above the shelves
were ranged the family portraits, a considerable array
of them, preserving the countenances of his progenitors.
Throughout the house there were pictures, chiefly representative
work of contemporary French and American
artists. When Mills got tired of a picture or saw a
chance to buy a better one by the same painter, he sold
or gave away the discard. He knew the contents of
his house from cellar to garret—roved over it a good
deal in his many lonely hours.</p>

<p>He came downstairs a few minutes before seven and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
from force of habit strolled through the rooms on a
tour of inspection. In keeping with his sense of personal
dignity, he always put on his dinner coat in the
evening, even when he was alone. He rang and asked
the smartly capped and aproned maid who responded
whether his daughter was at home.</p>

<p>“Miss Leila went to the Country Club this afternoon,
sir, and hasn’t come in yet. She said she was
dining here.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” he replied colorlessly, and turned to
glance over some new books neatly arranged on a
table at the side of the living-room. A clock struck
seven and on the last solemn stroke the remote titter
of an electric bell sent the maid to the door.</p>

<p>“Mr. and Mrs. Shepherd Mills,” the girl announced
in compliance with an established rule, which was not
suspended even when Mills’s son and daughter-in-law
were the guests.</p>

<p>“Shep fairly dragged me!” Mrs. Mills exclaimed as
she greeted her father-in-law. “He’s in such terror of
being late to one of your feasts! I know I’m a fright.”
She lifted her hand to her hair with needless solicitude;
it was perfectly arranged. She wore an evening
gown of sapphire blue chiffon,—an effective garment;
she knew that it was effective. Seeing that he was
eyeing it critically, she demanded to know what he
thought of it.</p>

<p>“You’re so fastidious, you know! Shep never pays
any attention to my clothes. It’s a silly idea that
women dress only for each other; it’s for captious men
like you that we take so much trouble.”</p>

<p>“You’re quite perfectly turned out, I should say,”
Mills remarked. “That’s a becoming gown. I don’t
believe I’ve seen it before.”</p>

<p>Her father-in-law was regarding her quizzically, an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
ambiguous smile playing about his lips. She was conscious
that he never gave her his whole approval and
she was piqued by her failure to evoke any expressions
of cordiality from him. Men usually liked her, or at
least found her amusing, and she had never been satisfied
that Franklin Mills either liked her or thought her
clever. It was still a source of bitterness that Mills
had objected strongly to Shepherd’s marrying her. His
objections she attributed to snobbery; for her family
was in nowise distinguished, and Constance, an only
child, had made her own way socially chiefly through
acquaintances and friendships formed in the Misses
Palmers’ school, a local institution which conferred a
certain social dignity upon its patrons.</p>

<p>She had never been able to break down Mills’s reserves,
and the tone which she had adopted for
her intercourse with him had been arrived at after
a series of experiments in the first year of her marriage.
He suffered this a little stolidly. There was a
point of discretion beyond which she never dared venture.
She had once tried teasing him about a young
widow, a visitor from the South for whom he had
shown some partiality, and he hadn’t liked it, though
he had taken the same sort of chaff from others in
her presence with perfect good nature.</p>

<p>Shepherd, she realized perfectly, was a disappointment
to his father. Countless points of failure in the
relationship of father and son were manifest to her,
things of which Shepherd himself was unconscious.
It was Mills’s family pride that had prompted him to
make Shepherd president of the storage battery company,
and the same vanity was responsible for the
house he had given Shepherd on his marriage—a much
bigger house than the young couple needed. He expected
her to bear children that the continuity of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
name might be unbroken, but the thought of bearing
children was repugnant to her. Still, the birth of an
heir, to take the name of Franklin Mills, would undoubtedly
heighten his respect for her—diminish the
veiled hostility which she felt she aroused in him.</p>

<p>“Where’s Leila?” asked Shepherd as dinner was announced
and they moved toward the dining-room.</p>

<p>“She’ll be along presently,” Mills replied easily.</p>

<p>“Dear Leila!” exclaimed Constance. “You never
disciplined her as you did Shep. Shep would go to
the stake before he’d turn up late.”</p>

<p>“Leila,” said Mills a little defensively, “is a law
unto herself.”</p>

<p>“That’s why we all love the dear child!” said Constance
quickly. “Not for worlds would I change her.”</p>

<p>To nothing was Mills so sensitive as to criticism of
Leila, a fact which she should have remembered.</p>

<p>As they took their places Mills asked her, in the
impersonal tone she hated, what the prospects were for
a gay winter. She was on the committee of the Assembly,
whose entertainments were a noteworthy feature
of every season. There, too, was the Dramatic Club,
equally exclusive in its membership, and Constance was
on the play committee. Mills listened with interest, or
with the pretense of interest, as she gave him the benefit
of her knowledge as to the winter’s social programme.</p>

<p>They were half through the dinner when Leila
arrived. With a cheerful “Hello, everybody,” she
flung off her wrap and without removing her hat, sank
into the chair Shepherd drew out for her.</p>

<p>“Sorry, Dada, but Millie and I played eighteen holes
this afternoon; got a late start and were perfectly
starved when we finished and just had to have tea.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
And some people came along and we got to talking
and it was dark before we knew it.”</p>

<p>“How’s your game coming on?” her father asked.</p>

<p>“Not so bad, Dada. Millie’s one of these lazy players;
she doesn’t care whether she wins or loses, and I
guess I’m too temperamental to be a good golfer.”</p>

<p>“I thought Millie was pretty strong on temperament
herself,” remarked Shepherd.</p>

<p>“Well, Millie is and she isn’t. She’s not the sort
that flies all to pieces when anything goes wrong.”</p>

<p>“Millie’s a pretty fine girl,” declared Shepherd.</p>

<p>“Millicent really has charm,” remarked Constance,
though without enthusiasm.</p>

<p>“Millie’s a perfect darling!” said Leila. “She’s so
lovely to her father and mother! They’re really very
nice. Everybody knocks Doc Harden, but he’s not a
bad sort. It’s a shame the way people treat them.
Mrs. Harden’s a dear, sweet thing; plain and sensible
and doesn’t look pained when I cuss a little.” She
gave her father a sly look, but he feigned inattention.
“Dada, how do you explain Millie?”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t,” replied Mills, with a broad smile at
the abruptness of the question. “It’s just as well that
everything and everybody on this planet can’t be explained
and don’t have to be. I’ve come to a time of
life when I’m a little fed up on things that can be
reduced to figures. I want to be mystified!”</p>

<p>Leila pointed her finger at him across the table.</p>

<p>“I’ll say you like mystery! If there was ever a
human being who just had to have the facts, you’re it!
I know because I’ve tried hiding milliners’ bills from
you.”</p>

<p>“Well, I usually pay them,” Mills replied good-humoredly.
“Now that you’ve spoken of bills, I’d
like to ask you——”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>“Don’t!” Leila ejaculated, placing her hands over
her ears with simulated horror. “I know what you’re
going to say. You’re going to ask why I bought that
new squirrel coat. Well, winter’s coming and it’s to
keep me from freezing to death.”</p>

<p>“Well, the house is well heated,” Mills replied dryly.
“The answer is for you to spend a little time at home.”</p>

<p>Leila was a spoiled child and lived her own life with
little paternal interference. After Mills had failed
utterly to keep her in school, or rather to find any
school in which she would stay, he had tried tutors
with no better results. He had finally placed her for
a year in New York with a woman who made a business
of giving the finishing touches to the daughters
of the provincial rich. There were no lessons to learn
which these daughters didn’t want to learn, but Leila
had heard operas and concerts to a point where she
really knew something of music, and she had acquired
a talent that greatly amused her father for talking convincingly
of things she really knew nothing about. He
found much less delight in her appalling habit of blurting
out things better left unsaid, and presumably foreign
to the minds of well-bred young women.</p>

<p>Her features were a feminized version of her
father’s; she was dark like him and with the same gray
eyes; but here the resemblance ended. She was alert,
restless, quick of speech and action. The strenuous life
of her long days was expressing itself in little nervous
twitchings of her hands and head. Her father, under
his benignant gaze, was noting these things now.</p>

<p>“I hope you’re staying in tonight, Leila?” he said.
“It seems to me you’re not sleeping enough.”</p>

<p>“Well, no, Dada. I was going to the Claytons’. I
told Fred Thomas he might come for me at nine.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>“Thomas?” Mills questioned. “I don’t know that
I’d choose him for an escort.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Freddy’s all right!” Leila replied easily. “He’s
always asking me to go places with him, and I’d turned
him down until I was ashamed to refuse any more.”</p>

<p>“I think,” said her father, “it might be as well to
begin refusing again. What about him, Shep?”</p>

<p>“He’s a good sort, I think,” Shepherd replied after
a hasty glance at his wife. “But of course——”</p>

<p>“Of course, he’s divorced,” interposed Constance,
“and he hasn’t been here long. But people I know in
Chicago say he was well liked there. What is it he
has gone into, Shep?”</p>

<p>“He came here to open a branch of a lumber company—a
large concern, I think,” Shepherd replied. “I
believe he <i>has</i> been divorced, Father, if that’s what’s
troubling you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, he told me all about the divorce!” interposed
Leila imperturbably. “His wife got crazy about another
man and—biff! Don’t worry, Dada; he isn’t
dangerous.”</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>When they had gone upstairs to the library for
coffee, Leila lighted a cigarette and proceeded to open
some letters that had been placed on a small desk kept
in the room for her benefit. She perched herself on
the desk and read aloud, between whiffs of her cigarette,
snatches of news from a letter. Shepherd
handed her a cup and she stirred her coffee, the cigarette
hanging from her lip. Constance feigned not to
notice a shadow of annoyance on her father-in-law’s
face as Leila, her legs dangling, occasionally kicked
the desk frame with her heels.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>“By the way, Leila,” said Constance, “the Nelsons
want to sell their place at Harbor Hills. They haven’t
been there for several years, you know. It’s one of
the best locations anywhere in Michigan. It would
solve the eternal summer problem for all of us—so
accessible and a marvelous view—and you could have
all the water sports you wanted. And they say the
new clubhouse is a perfect dream.”</p>

<p>Shepherd Mills’s cup tottered in its saucer with a
sharp staccato. He had warned his wife not to broach
the matter of purchasing the northern Michigan cottage,
which she had threatened to do for some time and
had discussed with Leila in the hope of enlisting her
as an ally for an effective assault upon Mills.</p>

<p>“It’s a peach of a place, all right,” Leila remarked.
“I wonder if the yacht goes with the house. I believe
I could use that yacht. Really, Dada, we ought to
have a regular summer place. I’m fed up on rented
cottages. If we had a house like the Nelsons’ we could
all use it.”</p>

<p>She had promised Constance to support the idea, but
her sister-in-law had taken her off guard and she was
aware that she hadn’t met the situation with quite the
enthusiasm it demanded. Mills was lighting a cigar
in his usual unhurried fashion. He knew that Constance
was in the habit of using Leila as an advocate
when she wanted him to do something extraordinary,
and Leila, to his secret delight, usually betrayed the
source of her inspiration.</p>

<p>“What do the Nelsons want for the property?” he
asked, settling himself back in his chair.</p>

<p>“I suppose the yacht isn’t included,” Constance answered.
“They’re asking seventy thousand for the
house, and there’s a lot of land, you know. The Nelsons<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
live in Detroit and it would be easy to get the
details.”</p>

<p>“You said yourself it was a beautiful place when
you were there last summer,” Leila resumed, groping
in her memory for the reasons with which Constance
had fortified her for urging the purchase. “And the
golf course up there is a wonder, and the whole place
is very exclusive—only the nicest people.”</p>

<p>“I thought you preferred the northeast coast,” her
father replied. “What’s sent you back to fresh water?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Dada, I just have to change my mind sometimes!
If I kept the same idea very long it would
turn bad—like an egg.”</p>

<p>Constance, irritated by Leila’s perfunctory espousal
of the proposed investment, tried to signal for silence.
But Leila, having undertaken to implant in her father’s
mind the desirability of acquiring the cottage at Harbor Hills,
was unwilling to drop the subject.</p>

<p>“Poor old Shep never gets any vacation to amount
to anything. If we had a place in Michigan he could
go up every week-end and get a breath of air. We
all of us could have a perfectly grand time.”</p>

<p>“Who’s all?” demanded her father. “You’d want
to run a select boarding house, would you?”</p>

<p>“Well, not exactly. But Connie and I could open
the place early and stay late, and we’d hope you’d be
with us all the time, and Shep, whenever he could
get away.”</p>

<p>“Shep, I think this is only a scheme to shake you
and me for the summer. Connie and Leila are trying
to put something over on us. And of course we can’t
stand for any such thing.”</p>

<p>“Of course, Father, the upkeep of such a place is
considerable,” Shepherd replied conciliatingly.</p>

<p>“Yes; quite as much as a town house, and you’d<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
never use it more than two or three months a year.
By the way, Connie, do you know those Cincinnati
Marvins Leila and I met up there?”</p>

<p>Connie knew that her father-in-law had, with characteristic
deftness, disposed of the Harbor Hills house
as effectually as though he had roared a refusal. Shepherd,
still smarting under the rejection of his plan for
giving his workmen a clubhouse, marveled at the suavity
with which his father eluded proposals that did not
impress him favorably. He wondered at times whether
his father was not in some degree a superman who in
his judgments and actions exercised a Jovian supremacy
over the rest of mankind. Leila, finding herself
bored by her father’s talk with Constance about the
Marvins, sprang from the table, stretched herself lazily
and said she guessed she would go and dress.</p>

<p>When she reached the door she turned toward him
with mischief in her eyes. “What are you up to tonight,
Dada? You might stroll over and see Millie!
The Claytons didn’t ask her to their party.”</p>

<p>“Thanks for the hint, dear,” Mills replied with
a tinge of irony.</p>

<p>“I think I’ll go with you,” said Constance, as Leila
impudently kissed her fingers to her father and turned
toward her room. “Whistle for me at eight-thirty,
Shep.”</p>

<p>Both men rose as the young women left the room—Franklin
Mills was punctilious in all the niceties of
good manners—but before resuming his seat he closed
the door. There was something ominous in this, and
Shepherd nervously lighted a cigarette. He covertly
glanced at his watch to fix in his mind the amount of
time he must remain with his father before Constance
returned. He loved and admired his wife and he envied<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
her the ease with which she ignored or surmounted
difficulties.</p>

<p>Connie made mistakes in dealing with her father-in-law
and Shepherd was aware of this, but his own
errors in this respect only served to strengthen his
reliance on the understanding and sympathy of his
wife, who was an adept in concealing disappointment
and discomfiture. When Shepherd was disposed to
complain of his father, Connie was always consoling.
She would say:</p>

<p>“You’re altogether too sensitive, Shep. It’s an old
trick of fathers to treat their sons as though they were
still boys. Your father can’t realize that you’re grown
up. But he knows you stick to your job and that you’re
anxious to please him. I suppose he thought you’d
grow up to be just like himself; but you’re not, so it’s
up to him to take you as the pretty fine boy you are.
You’re the steadiest young man in town and you needn’t
think he doesn’t appreciate that.”</p>

<p>Shepherd, fortifying himself with a swift recollection
of his wife’s frequent reassurances of this sort,
nevertheless wished that she had not run off to gossip
with Leila. However, the interview would be brief,
and he played with his cigarette while he waited for
his father to begin.</p>

<p>“There’s something I’ve wanted to talk with you
about, Shep. It will take only a minute.”</p>

<p>“Yes, father.”</p>

<p>“It’s about Leila”—he hesitated—“a little bit about
Constance, too. I’m not altogether easy about Leila.
I mean”—he paused again—“as to Connie’s influence
over your sister. Connie is enough older to realize
that Leila needs a little curbing as to things I can’t
talk to her about as a woman could. Leila doesn’t
need to be encouraged in extravagance. And she likes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
running about well enough without being led into things
she might better let alone. I’m not criticizing Connie’s
friends, but you do have at your house people
I’d rather Leila didn’t know—at least not to be intimate
with them. As a concrete example, I don’t care
for this fellow Thomas. To be frank, I’ve made some
inquiries about him and he’s hardly the sort of person
you’d care for your sister to run around with.”</p>

<p>Shepherd, blinking under this succession of direct
statements, felt that some comment was required.</p>

<p>“Of course, father, Connie wouldn’t take up anyone
she didn’t think perfectly all right. And she’d never
put any undesirable acquaintances in Leila’s way.
She’s too fond of Leila and too deeply interested in her
happiness for that.”</p>

<p>“I wasn’t intimating that Connie was consciously
influencing Leila in a wrong way in that particular
instance. But Leila is very impressionable. So far
I’ve been able to eliminate young men I haven’t liked.
I’m merely asking your cooperation, and Connie’s, in
protecting her. She’s very headstrong and rather disposed
to take advantage of our position by running a
little wild. Our friends no doubt make allowances,
but people outside our circle may not be so tolerant.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s all perfectly true, father,” Shepherd
assented, relieved and not a little pleased that his
father appeared to be criticizing him less than asking
his assistance.</p>

<p>“For another thing,” Mills went on. “Leila has
somehow got into the habit of drinking. Several times
I’ve seen her when she’d had too much. That sort
of thing won’t do!”</p>

<p>“Of course not! But I’m sure Connie hasn’t been
encouraging Leila to drink. She and I both have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
talked to her about that. I hoped she’d stop it before
you found it out.”</p>

<p>“Don’t ever get the idea that I don’t know what’s
going on!” Mills retorted tartly. “Another thing I
want to speak of is Connie’s way of getting Leila to
back her schemes—things like that summer place, for
example. We don’t need a summer place. The idea
that you can’t have a proper vacation is all rubbish. I
urged you all summer to take Connie East for a
month.”</p>

<p>“I know you did. It was my own fault I didn’t go.
Please don’t think we’re complaining; Connie and I get
a lot of fun just motoring. And when you’re at the
farm we enjoy running out there. I think, Father, that
sometimes you’re not—not—quite just to Connie.”</p>

<p>“Not just to her!” exclaimed Mills, with a lifting
of the brows. “In what way have I been unjust to
her?”</p>

<p>Shepherd knew that his remark was unfortunate
before it was out of his mouth. He should have followed
his habit of assenting to what his father said
without broadening the field of discussion. He was
taken aback by his father’s question, uttered with what
was, for Franklin Mills, an unusual display of asperity.</p>

<p>“I only meant,” Shepherd replied hastily, “that you
don’t always”—he frowned—“you don’t quite give
Connie credit for her fine qualities.”</p>

<p>“Quite the contrary,” Mills replied. “My only concern
as her father-in-law is that she shall continue to
display those qualities. I realize that she’s a popular
young woman, but in a way you pay for that, and I
stand for it and make it possible for you to spend the
money. Now don’t jump to the conclusion that I’m
intimating that you and Connie wouldn’t have just
as many friends if you spent a tenth of what you’re<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
spending now. Be it far from me, my boy, to discredit
your value and Connie’s as social factors!”</p>

<p>Mills laughed to relieve the remark of any suspicion
of irony. There was nothing Shepherd dreaded so
much as his father’s ironies. The dread was the
greater because there was always a disturbing uncertainty
as to what they concealed.</p>

<p>“About those little matters I mentioned,” Mills went
on, “I count on you to help.”</p>

<p>“Certainly, father. Connie and I both will do all
we can. I’m glad you spoke to me about it.”</p>

<p>“All right, Shep,” and Mills opened the door to
mark the end of the interview.</p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>In Leila’s room Constance had said, the moment
they were alone:</p>

<p>“Well, you certainly gummed it!”</p>

<p>“Oh, shoot! Dada wouldn’t buy that Nelson place
if it only cost a nickel.”</p>

<p>“Well, you didn’t do much to advance the cause!”</p>

<p>“See here,” said Leila, “one time’s just as good as
another with Dada. I knew he’d never agree to it. I
only spoke of it because you gave me the lead. You
never seem to learn his curves.”</p>

<p>“If you’d backed me up right we could have got him
interested and won him over. Anybody could see that
he was away off tonight—even more difficult than
usual!”</p>

<p>“Oh, tush! You and Shep make me tired. You
take father too seriously. All you’ve got to do with
him is just to kid him along. Let’s have a little drink
to drown our troubles.”</p>

<p>“Now, Leila——”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>Leila had drawn a hat-box from the inner recesses
of a closet and extracted from it a quart bottle of
whiskey.</p>

<p>“I’m all shot to hell and need a spoonful of this
stuff to pep me up! Hands off, old thing! Don’t
touch—Leila scream!” Constance had tried to seize
the bottle.</p>

<p>“Leila, <i>please</i> don’t drink! The Claytons are having
everybody of any consequence at this party and if
you go reeking of liquor all the old tabbies will babble!”</p>

<p>“Well, darling, let them talk! At least they will
talk about both of us then!”</p>

<p>“Who’s talking about me?” Constance demanded.</p>

<p>“Be calm, dearest! You certainly wore the guilty
look then. Let’s call it quits—I’ve got to dress!”</p>

<p>She poured herself a second drink and restored the
bottle to its hiding place.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER SIX</h2>
</div>


<h3>I</h3>

<p>Several interviews with Freeman had resulted in an
arrangement by which Bruce was to enter the architect’s
office immediately. As Henderson had predicted,
Mrs. Freeman was a real power in her husband’s affairs.
She confided to Bruce privately that, with all
his talents, Bill lacked tact in dealing with his clients
and he needed someone to supply this deficiency. And
the office was a place of confusion, and Bill was prone
to forgetfulness. Bruce, Mrs. Freeman thought, could
be of material assistance in keeping Bill straight and
extricating him from the difficulties into which he constantly
stumbled in his absorption in the purely artistic
side of his profession. Bruce was put to work
on tentative sketches and estimates for a residence for
a man who had no very clear idea of what he wanted
nor how much he wanted to spend.</p>

<p>Bruce soon discovered that Freeman disliked interviews
with contractors and the general routine necessary
to keep in touch with the cost of labor and materials.
When he was able to visualize and create he was
happy, but tedious calculations left him sulky and disinclined
to work. Bruce felt no such repugnance; he
had a kind of instinct for such things, and was able to
carry in his head a great array of facts and figures.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>On his first free evening after meeting Millicent
Harden at the Country Club he rang the Harden doorbell,
and as he waited glanced toward the Mills’ house
in the lot adjoining. He vaguely wondered whether
Franklin Mills was within its walls.</p>

<p>He had tried to analyze the emotions that had beset
him that night when he had taken the hand of the man
he believed to be his father. There was something
cheap and vulgar in the idea that blood speaks to blood
and that possibly Mills had recognized him by some
sort of intuition. But Bruce rejected this as preposterous,
a concession to the philosophy of ignorant old
women muttering scandal before a dying fire. Very
likely he had been wrong in fancying that Mills had
taken any special note of him. And there was always
his mother’s assurance that Mills didn’t know of his
existence. Mills probably had the habit of eyeing
people closely; he shouldn’t have permitted himself to
be troubled by that. He was a man of large affairs,
with faculties trained to the quick inspection and
appraisment of every stranger he met....</p>

<p>The middle-aged woman who opened the door was
evidently a member of the household and he hastily
thrust into his pocket the card he had taken out, stated
his name and asked if Miss Harden was at home.</p>

<p>“Yes, Millie’s home. Just come in, Mr. Storrs, and
I’ll call her.”</p>

<p>But Millicent came into the hall without waiting
to be summoned.</p>

<p>“I’m so glad to see you, Mr. Storrs!” she said, and
introduced him to her mother, a tall, heavily built
woman with reddish hair turning gray, and a friendly
countenance.</p>

<p>“I was just saying to Doctor Harden that I guessed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
nobody was coming in tonight when you rang. You
simply can’t keep a servant in to answer the bell in the
evening. You haven’t met Doctor Harden? Millie,
won’t you call your papa?”</p>

<p>Millicent opened a door that revealed a small, cozy
sitting-room and summoned her father—a short, thick-set
man with a close-trimmed gray beard, who came
out clutching a newspaper.</p>

<p>“Shan’t we all go into the library?” asked Millicent
after the two men had been introduced and had expressed
their approval of the prolonged fine weather.</p>

<p>“You young folks make yourselves comfortable in
the library,” said Mrs. Harden. “I told Millie it was
too warm for a fire, but she just has to have the fireplace
going when there’s any excuse, and this house
does get chilly in the fall evenings even when it’s warm
outside.”</p>

<p>Harden was already retreating toward the room
from which he had been drawn to meet the caller, and
his wife immediately followed. Both repeated their
expressions of pleasure at meeting Bruce; but presumably,
in the accepted fashion of American parents when
their daughters entertain callers, they had no intention
of appearing again.</p>

<p>Millicent snapped on lights that disclosed a long,
high-ceilinged room finished in dark oak and fitted up
as a library. A disintegrating log in the broad fireplace
had thrown out a puff of smoke that gave the
air a fleeting pungent scent.</p>

<p>The flooring was of white and black tiles covered
with oriental rugs in which the dominant dark red
brought a warmth to the eye. Midway of the room
stood a grand piano, and beyond it a spiral stair led
to a small balcony on which the console of an organ
was visible. Back of this was a stained glass window<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
depicting a knight in armor—a challenging, militant
figure. Even as revealed only by the inner illumination,
its rich colors and vigorous draughtsmanship
were clearly suggested. And it was wholly appropriate,
Bruce decided, and altogether consonant with the
general scheme of the room. Noting his interest, Millicent
turned a switch that lighted the window from a
room beyond with the effect of vitalizing the knight’s
figure, making him seem indeed to be gravely riding,
with lance in rest, along the wall.</p>

<p>“Do pardon me!” Bruce murmured, standing just
inside the door and glancing about with frank enjoyment
of the room’s spaciousness. The outer lines of
the somewhat commonplace square brick house had
not prepared him for this. The room presented a
mingling of periods in both architecture and furnishing,
but the blending had been admirably done.</p>

<p>“Forgive me for staring,” he said as he sat down
on a divan opposite her with the hearth between them.
“I’m not sure even yet that I’m in the twentieth century!”</p>

<p>“I suppose it is a queer jumble; but don’t blame the
architect! He, poor wretch, thought we were perfectly
crazy when we started, but I think before he
got through he really liked it.”</p>

<p>“I envy him the fun he had doing it! But someone
must have furnished the inspiration. I’m going to
assume that it was mostly you.”</p>

<p>“You may if you’ll go ahead and criticize—tear it
all to pieces.”</p>

<p>“I’d as soon think of criticizing Chartres, Notre
Dame, or the hand that rounded Peter’s dome!” Bruce
exclaimed. “Alas that our acquaintance is so brief!
I want to ask you all manner of questions—how you
came to do it—and all that.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>“Well, first of all one must have an indulgent father
and mother. I’m reminded occasionally that my little
whims were expensive.”</p>

<p>“I dare say they were! But it’s something to have
a daughter who can produce a room like this.”</p>

<p>He rose and bowed to her, and then turning toward
the knight in the window, gravely saluted.</p>

<p>“I’m not so sure,” he said as he sat down, “that the
gentleman up there didn’t have something to do with
it.”</p>

<p>“Please don’t make too much of him. Everyone
pays me the compliment of thinking him Galahad, but
I think of him as the naughty Launcelot. I read a
book once on old French glass and I just had to have
a window. And the organ made this room the logical
place for it. Papa calls this my chapel and refuses
to sit in it at all. He says it’s too much like church!”</p>

<p>“Ah! But that’s a tribute in itself! Your father
realizes that this is a place for worship—without reference
to the knight.”</p>

<p>She laid her forefinger against her cheek, tilted her
head slightly, mocking him with lips and eyes.</p>

<p>“Let me think! That was a pretty speech, but of
course you’re referring to that bronze Buddha over
there. Come to think of it, papa does rather fancy
him.”</p>

<p>When she smilingly met his gaze he laughed and
made a gesture of despair.</p>

<p>“That was a nice bit of side-stepping! I’m properly
rebuked. I see my own worshiping must be done with
caution. But the room is beautiful. I’m glad to know
there’s such a place in town.”</p>

<p>“I did have a good time planning and arranging it.
But there’s nothing remarkable about it after all. It’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
merely what you might call a refuge from reality—if
that means anything.”</p>

<p>“It means a lot—too much for me to grasp all at
once.”</p>

<p>“You’re making fun of me! All I meant was that
I wanted a place to escape into where I can play at
being something I really am not. We all need to do
that. After all, it’s just a room.”</p>

<p>“Of course that’s just what it isn’t! It’s superb.
I’ve already decided to spend a lot of time here.”</p>

<p>“You may, if you won’t pick up little chance phrases
I let fall and frighten me with them. I have a friend—an
awful highbrow—and he bores me to death exclaiming
over things I say and can’t explain and then explaining
them to me. But—why aren’t you at the
Claytons’ party?”</p>

<p>“I wasn’t asked,” he said. “I don’t know them.”</p>

<p>“I know them, but I wasn’t asked,” she replied
smilingly.</p>

<p>“Well, anyhow, it’s nicer here, I think.”</p>

<p>Bruce remembered what Henderson had said about
the guarded social acceptance of the patent medicine
manufacturer and his family; but Millicent evidently
didn’t resent her exclusion from the Claytons’ party.
Social differentiations, Bruce imagined, mattered little
to this girl, who was capable of fashioning her own
manner of life, even to the point of building a temple
for herself in which to worship gods of her own choosing.
When he expressed interest in her modeling,
which Dale Freeman had praised, Millicent led the
way to a door opening into an extension of the
library beyond the knight’s window, that served her
as a studio. It was only a way of amusing herself,
she said, when he admired a plaque of a child’s profile
she confessed to be her work. The studio bore traces<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
of recent use. Damp cloths covered several unfinished
figures. There was a drawing-board in one corner and
scattered among the casts on the wall were crayon
sketches, merely notes, she explained, tacked up to
preserve her impressions of faces that had interested
her.</p>

<p>He was struck by her freedom from pretense; when
he touched on something of which she was ignorant
or about which she was indifferent, she did not scruple
to say so. Her imaginative, poetical side expressed
itself with healthy candor and frequent flashes of girlish
enthusiasm. She was wholly natural, refreshingly
spontaneous in speech, with no traces of pedantry or
conceit even in discussing music, in which her training
had gone beyond the usual amateur’s bounds.</p>

<p>“You haven’t been to see Leila yet? She asked you
to call, and if you don’t go she’ll think it’s because of
that little unpleasantness on the river. Leila’s altogether
worth while.”</p>

<p>Bruce muttered something about having been very
busy. He had determined never to enter Franklin
Mills’s house, and he was embarrassed by Millicent’s
intimation that Leila might take it amiss that he ignored
her invitation.</p>

<p>“Leila’s a real person,” Millicent was saying. “Her
great trouble is in trying to adjust herself to a way of
life that doesn’t suit her a little bit.”</p>

<p>“You mean——” he began and paused because he
didn’t know at all what she meant.</p>

<p>“I mean that living in a big house and going to teas
and upholding the dignity of a prominent and wealthy
family bores her to distraction. Her chief trouble is
her way of protesting against the kind of life she’s
born to. It’s screamingly funny, but Leila just hates<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
being rich, and she’s terribly bored at having so much
expected of her as her father’s daughter.”</p>

<p>“His standard, then, is so high?” Bruce ventured,
curious as to what further she might say of her
neighbor.</p>

<p>“Oh, Mr. Mills is an interesting man, and he worships
Leila; but she worries and puzzles him. It isn’t
just the difference between age and youth——” She
paused, conscious perhaps of the impropriety of discussing
her neighbor with a comparative stranger, but
Bruce’s gravely attentive face prompted her to go on.
“He’s one of those people we meet sometimes who
don’t seem—how can one put it?—they don’t seem
quite at ease in the world.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” he said slowly, “but—where all the conditions
of happiness are given—money, position, leisure to do
as you please—what excuse has anyone for not finding
happiness? You’d conclude that there was some fundamental
defect——”</p>

<p>“And when you reach that conclusion you’re not a
bit better off!” she interrupted. “You’re back where
you started. Oh, well!” she said, satisfied now that
she had said quite enough about her neighbor and regretting
that she had mentioned him at all, “it’s too
bad happiness can’t be bought as you buy records to
play on a machine and have nothing to do but wind it
up and listen. You have to do a little work yourself.”</p>

<p>“We’ve all got to play in the band—that’s the idea!”
he laughed, and to escape from the thought of Mills,
asked her whether she ever played for an ignorant
heathen like himself.</p>

<p>“You’re probably a stern critic,” she replied, “but
I’ll take a chance. If you don’t mind I’ll try the organ.
Papa and Mamma always like me to play some old<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
pieces for them before they go to bed. Afterwards
I’ll do some other things.”</p>

<p>In a moment she was in the balcony with the knight
towering above her, but he faded into the shadows as
she turned off the lights in the studio below. Bruce’s
eyes at once became attentive to her golden head and
clearly limned profile defined by the lamp over the
music rack. She seemed suddenly infinitely remote,
caught away into a world of legendary and elusive
things. The first reedy notes of the organ stole eerily
through the room as though they too were evoked from
an unseen world.</p>

<p>The first things she played were a concession to her
parents’ taste, but she threw into them all the sentiment
they demanded—the familiar airs of “Annie
Laurie,” “Ben Bolt,” and “Auld Lang Syne.” She
played them without flourishes, probably in deference
to the preferences of the father and mother who were
somewhere listening. To these she added old revival
songs—“Beulah Land,” and “Pull for the Shore”—these
also presumably favorites of the unseen auditors.
He watched her aureoled head, the graceful movement
of her arms and shoulders as she gave herself to her
task with complete absorption. She was kind to these
parents of hers; possibly it was through her music
that she really communicated with them, met them on
ground of their simpler knowledge and aspirations.</p>

<p>He was conscious presently of the faint ring of a
bell, followed by the murmur of voices in the hall.
Someone entered the room and sat down quietly behind
him. Millicent, who had paid no heed to him
since mounting to the organ, was just beginning the
Tannhäuser overture. She followed this with passages
from Lohengrin and Parsifal and classical liturgical
music touched with a haunting mystery....</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>She came down slowly into the room as though the
spell of the music still held her.</p>

<p>“I shan’t say anything—it might be the wrong word,”
he said as he went to meet her. “But it was beautiful—very
beautiful!”</p>

<p>“You were a good listener; I felt that,” she replied.</p>

<p>He had forgotten that there had been another listener
until she smilingly waved her hand to someone behind
him.</p>

<p>“So I had two victims—and didn’t know it! Patient
sufferers! Mr. Mills, you and Mr. Storrs have
met—I needn’t introduce you a second time.”</p>

<p>It was Franklin Mills, then, exercising a neighbor’s
privilege, who had arrived in the middle of the recital
and taken a seat by the door.</p>

<p>“Mr. Storrs is a perfect listener,” Mills was saying
as he shook hands with Bruce. “He didn’t budge all
the time you were playing.”</p>

<p>Mills’s easy, gracious manners, the intimacy implied
in his chaffing tone as he complained that she
played better when she didn’t know he was in the
house, irritated Bruce. He had been enjoying himself
so keenly, the girl’s talk had so interested him and he
had been so thrilled and lifted by her music that Mills’s
appearance was like a profanation.</p>

<p>They were all seated now, and Millicent spoke of a
book Mills had sent her which it happened Bruce had
read, and she asked his opinion of it before expressing
her own. Very likely Mills was in the habit of sending
her books. She said that she hadn’t cared greatly for
the book—a novel that discussed the labor question.
The author evidently had no solution of his own problem
and left the reader in the air as to his purpose.</p>

<p>“Maybe he only meant to arouse interest—stir people
up and leave the solution to others,” Bruce suggested.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>“That was the way I took it,” said Mills. “The fact
is, nobody has any solution short of a complete tearing
down of everything. And that,” he added with a smile
and a shrug, “would be very uncomfortable.”</p>

<p>“For us—yes,” Millicent replied quickly. “But a
good many of our millions would probably welcome a
chance to begin over again.”</p>

<p>“What with,” Mills demanded, “when everything
had been smashed?”</p>

<p>“Oh, they’d be sure to save something out of the
wreck!” Millicent replied.</p>

<p>“Well,” Mills remarked, “I’m hoping the smash
won’t come in my day. I’m too old to go out with a
club to fight for food against the mob.”</p>

<p>“You want us to say that you’re <i>not</i> too old,”
laughed Millicent; “but we’re not going to fall into
that trap!”</p>

<p>“But—what <i>is</i> going to happen?” asked Bruce.</p>

<p>“Other civilizations!” Mills replied, regarding the
young man with an intent look. “We’ve had a succession
of them, and the world’s about due to slip back
into chaos and perhaps emerge again. It’s only the
barbarians who never change; they know they’ll be on
top again if they just wait.”</p>

<p>“What an optimist you are!” cried Millicent. “But
you don’t really believe such things.”</p>

<p>“Of course I do,” Mills answered with a broad
smile.</p>

<p>She made it necessary for Bruce to assist her in combating
Mills’s hopeless view of the future, though she
bore the main burden of the opposition herself. Mills’s
manner was one of good-natured indulgence; but Bruce
was wondering whether there was not a deep vein of
cynicism in the man. Mills was clever at fencing, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
some of the things he said lightly no doubt expressed
real convictions.</p>

<p>Bruce was about to take his leave when Mills with
assumed petulance declared that the fire had been
neglected and began poking the embers. Carefully
putting the poker and tongs back in the rack, he lounged
toward the door, paused halfway and said good-night
formally, bowing first to one and then the other.</p>

<p>“Come in again sometime!” Millicent called after
him.</p>

<p>“Is that impudence?” Mills replied, reappearing from
the hall with his coat and hat. In a moment the door
closed and they heard the sound of his stick on the
walk outside.</p>

<p>“He’s always like that,” Millicent remarked after a
moment of silence. “It’s understood that he may come
in when I’m playing and leave when he pleases. Sometimes
when I’m at the organ he sits for an hour without
my knowing he’s here. It made me nervous at
first—just remembering that he <i>might</i> be here; but I
got over that when I found that he really enjoyed the
playing. I’m sorry he didn’t stay longer and really
talk; he wasn’t at his best tonight.”</p>

<p>Bruce made the merest murmur of assent, but something
in Mills’s quizzical, mocking tone, the very manner
of his entrance into the house, affected him disagreeably.</p>

<p>He realized that he was staying too long for a first
call, but he lingered until they had regained the cheery
note with which the evening began, and said good
night.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>When he reached the street Bruce decided to walk<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
the mile that lay between the Hardens’ and his apartment.
His second meeting with Franklin Mills had
left his mind in tumult. He was again beset by an
impulse to flee from the town, but this he fought and
vanquished.</p>

<p>Happiness and peace were not to be won by flight.
In his soldiering he had never feared bodily injury, and
at times when he had speculated as to the existence of
a soul he had decided that if he possessed such a
thing he would not suffer it to play the coward. But
this unexpected meeting at the Hardens’, which was
likely to be repeated if he continued his visits to the
house, had shaken his nerve more than he liked to
believe possible. Millicent evidently admired Mills,
sympathized with him in his loneliness, was flattered
perhaps by his visits to her home in search of solace
and cheer, or whatever it was Mills sought.</p>

<p>The sky was overcast and a keen autumn wind
whipped the overhanging maples as Bruce strode homeward
with head bent, his hands thrust deep into the
pockets of his overcoat. He hummed and whistled
phrases of the Parsifal, with his thoughts playing about
Millicent’s head as she had sat at the organ with the
knight keeping watch above her. After all, it was
through beautiful things, man-made and God-made, as
his mother had taught him, that life found its highest
realizations. In this idea there was an infinite stimulus.
Millicent had found for herself this clue to
happiness and was a radiant proof of its efficacy. It
had been a privilege to see her in her own house, to
enjoy contact with her questioning, meditative mind,
and to lose himself in her entrancing music.</p>

<p>The street was deserted and only a few of the houses
he passed showed lights. Bruce experienced again, as
often in his night tramps during the year of his exile, a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
happy sense of isolation. He was so completely absorbed
in his thoughts that he was unaware of the
propinquity of another pedestrian who was slowly approaching
as though as unheedful as he of the driving
wind and the first fitful patter of rain. They passed
so close that their arms touched. Both turned, staring
blankly in the light of the street lamps, and muttered
confused apologies.</p>

<p>“Oh, Storrs!” Franklin Mills exclaimed, bending
his head against the wind.</p>

<p>“Sorry to have bumped into you, sir,” Bruce replied,
and feeling that nothing more was required of him, he
was about to go on, but Mills said quickly:</p>

<p>“We’re in for a hard rain. Come back to my house—it’s
only half a dozen blocks—and I’ll send you
home.”</p>

<p>There was something of kindly peremptoriness in
his tone, and Bruce, at a loss for words with which to
refuse, followed, thinking that he would walk a block
to meet the demands of courtesy and turn back. Mills,
forging ahead rapidly, complained good-naturedly of
the weather.</p>

<p>“I frequently prowl around at night,” he explained;
“I sleep better afterwards.”</p>

<p>“I like a night walk myself,” Bruce replied.</p>

<p>“Not afraid of hold-ups? I was relieved to find it
was you I ran into. My daughter says I’m bound to
get sandbagged some night.”</p>

<p>At the end of the first block both were obliged to
battle against the wind, which now drove the rain in
furious gusts through the intersecting streets. In
grasping his hat, Mills dropped his stick, and after
picking it up, Bruce took hold of his arm for their
greater ease in keeping together. It would, he decided,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
be an ungenerous desertion to leave him now, and so
they arrived after much buffeting at Mills’s door.</p>

<p>“That’s a young hurricane,” said Mills as he let
himself in. “When you’ve dried out a bit I’ll send
you on in my car.”</p>

<p>In response to his ring a manservant appeared and
carried away their hats and overcoats to be dried. Mills
at once led the way upstairs to the library, where a fire
had been kindled, probably against the master’s return
in the storm.</p>

<p>“Sit close and put your feet to the blaze. I think
a hot drink would be a help.”</p>

<p>Hot water and Scotch were brought and Mills
laughingly assured Bruce that he needn’t be afraid of
the liquor.</p>

<p>“I had it long before Prohibition. Of course, everybody
has to say that!”</p>

<p>In his wildest speculations as to possible meetings
with his father, Bruce had imagined nothing like this.
He was not only in Franklin Mills’s house, but the man
was graciously ministering to his comfort. And Bruce,
with every desire to resist, to refuse these courteous
offices, was meekly submitting. Mills, talking easily,
with legs stretched to the fire, sipped his drink contentedly
while the storm beat with mounting fury round
the house.</p>

<p>“I think my son said you had been in the army; I
should say that the experience hadn’t done you any
harm,” Mills remarked in his pleasant voice.</p>

<p>“Quite the contrary, sir. The knocking about I got
did me good.”</p>

<p>“I envy you young fellows the experience; it was a
ghastly business, but it must mean a lot in a man’s life
to have gone through it.”</p>

<p>In response to a direct question Bruce stated concisely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
the nature of his service. His colorless recital
of the bare record brought a smile to Mills’s face.</p>

<p>“You’re like all the young fellows I’ve talked with—modest,
even a little indifferent about it. I think if
I’d been over there I should do some bragging!”</p>

<p>Still bewildered to find himself at Mills’s fireside,
Bruce was wondering how soon he could leave; but
Mills talked on in leisurely fashion of the phenomenal
growth of the town and the opportunities it offered to
young men. Bruce was ashamed of himself for not
being more responsive; but Mills seemed content to
ramble on, though carefully attentive to the occasional
remarks Bruce roused himself to make. Bruce, with
ample opportunity, observed Mills’s ways—little tricks
of speech, the manner in which he smoked—lazily
blowing rings at intervals and watching them waver
and break—an occasional quick lifting of his well-kept
hand to his forehead.</p>

<p>It was after they had been together for half an hour
that Bruce noted that Mills, after meeting his gaze,
would lift his eyes and look intently at something on
the wall over the bookcases—something immediately
behind Bruce and out of the range of his vision. It
seemed not to be the unseeing stare of inattention;
but whatever it was, it brought a look of deepening perplexity—almost
of alarm—to Mills’s face. Bruce began
to find this upward glance disconcerting, and evidently
aware that his visitor was conscious of it, Mills
got up and, with the pretence of offering his guest another
cigarette, reseated himself in a different position.</p>

<p>“I must run along,” said Bruce presently. “The
storm is letting up. I can easily foot it home.”</p>

<p>“Not at all! After keeping you till midnight I’ll
certainly not send you out to get another wetting.
There’s still quite a splash on the windows.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>He rang for the car before going downstairs, and
while he was waiting for the chauffeur to answer on the
garage extension of the house telephone, Bruce, from
the fireplace, saw that it must have been a portrait—one
of a number ranged along the wall—that had invited
Mills’s gaze so frequently. It was the portrait
of a young man, the work of a painstaking if not a
brilliant artist. The clean-shaven face, the long, thick,
curly brown hair, and the flowing scarf knotted under
a high turn-over collar combined in an effect of
quaintness.</p>

<p>There was something oddly familiar in the young
man’s countenance. In the few seconds that Mills’s
back was turned Bruce found himself studying it, wondering
what there was about it that teased his memory—what
other brow and eyes and clean-cut, firm mouth
he had ever seen were like those of the young man
who was looking down at him from Franklin Mills’s
wall. And then it dawned upon him that the face was
like his own—might, indeed, with a different arrangement
of the hair, a softening of certain lines, pass for
a portrait of himself.</p>

<p>Mills, turning from the telephone, remarked that
the car was on the way.</p>

<p>“Ah!” he added quickly, seeing Bruce’s attention
fixed on the portrait, “my father, at about thirty-five.
There’s nothing of me there; I take after my mother’s
side of the house. Father was taller than I and his
features were cleaner cut. He died twenty years ago.
I’ve always thought him a fine American type. Those
other——”</p>

<p>Bruce lent polite attention to Mills’s comments on
the other portraits, one representing his maternal
grandfather and another a great-uncle who had been
killed in the Civil War. When they reached the lower<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
floor Mills opened the door of a reception room and
turned on the frame lights about a full-length portrait
of a lady in evening dress.</p>

<p>“That is Mrs. Mills,” he said, “and an excellent
likeness.”</p>

<p>He spoke in sophisticated terms of American portraiture
as they went to the hall where the servant was
waiting with Bruce’s hat and coat. A limousine was
in the porte-cochère, and Mills stood on the steps until
Bruce got in.</p>

<p>“I thank you very much, Mr. Mills,” Bruce said,
taking the hand Mills extended.</p>

<p>“Oh, I owe you the thanks! I hope to see you again
very soon!”</p>

<p>Mills on his way to his room found himself clinging
to the stair rail. When he had closed the door he
drew his hand slowly across his eyes. He had spoken
with Marian Storrs’s son and the young man by an
irony of nature had the countenance, the high-bred
air of Franklin Mills III. It was astounding, this
skipping for a generation of a type! It seemed to
Mills, after he had turned off the lights, that his father’s
eyes—the eyes of young Storrs—were still fixed upon
him with a disconcerting gravity.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER SEVEN</h2>
</div>


<h3>I</h3>

<p>In the fortnight following his encounter with Mills
at the Hardens’, and the later meeting that same night
in the storm, Bruce had thrown himself with fierce
determination into his work. There must be no repetitions
of such meetings; they added to his self-consciousness,
made him ill at ease even when walking the
streets in which at a turn of any corner he might run
into Mills.</p>

<p>He had never known that he had a nerve in his body,
but now he was aware of disturbing sensations, inability
to concentrate on his work, even a tremor of the
hands as he bent over his drawing-board. His abrupt
change from the open road to an office in some measure
accounted for this and he began going to a public golf
links on Saturday afternoons and Sundays, and against
the coming of winter he had his name proposed for
membership in an athletic club.</p>

<p>He avoided going anywhere that might bring him
again in contact with the man he believed to be his
father. Shepherd Mills he ran into at the University
Club now and then, and he was not a little ashamed
of himself for repelling the young man’s friendly overtures.
Shepherd, evidently feeling that he must in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
some way explain his silence about the clubhouse, for
which Bruce had made tentative sketches, spoke of the
scheme one day as a matter he was obliged to defer for
the present.</p>

<p>“It’s a little late in the season to begin; and father’s
doubtful about it—thinks it might cause feeling among
the men in other concerns. I hadn’t thought of that
aspect of the matter——”</p>

<p>Shepherd paused and frowned as he waited for Bruce
to offer some comment on the abandonment of the
project. It was none of Bruce’s affair, but he surmised
that the young man had been keenly disappointed by
his father’s refusal.</p>

<p>“Oh, well, it doesn’t matter!” Bruce remarked as
though it were merely a professional matter of no great
importance. But as he left Shepherd he thought intently
about the relations of the father and son. They
were utterly irreconcilable natures. Having met
Franklin Mills, sat at his fireside, noted with full understanding
the man’s enjoyment of ease and luxury,
it was not difficult to understand his lack of sympathy
with Shepherd’s radical tendencies. Piecing together
what he had heard about Mills from Henderson and
Millicent Harden with his own estimate, Bruce was
confident that whatever else Franklin Mills might be
he was no altruist.</p>

<p>After he left Shepherd Bruce was sorry that he had
been so brusque. He might at least have expressed his
sympathy with the young man’s wish to do something
to promote the happiness of his workmen. The vitality
so evident in Franklin Mills’s vigorous figure, and his
perfect poise, made Shepherd appear almost ridiculous
in contrast.</p>

<p>Bruce noted that the other young men about the
club did not treat Shepherd quite as one of themselves.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
When Shepherd sat at the big round table in the grill
he would listen to the ironic give and take of the others
with a pathetic eagerness to share in their good fellowship,
but unable to make himself quite one of
them. This might have been due, Bruce thought, to
the anxiety of Shepherd’s contemporaries—young fellows
he had grown up with—to show their indifference
to the fact that he was the son of the richest man in
town. Or they felt, perhaps, that Shepherd was not
equal to his opportunities. Clearly, however, no one
ever had occasion to refer to Shepherd Mills as the
typical young scion of a wealthy family whose evil
ways were bound to land him in the poorhouse or the
gutter.</p>

<p>In other circumstances Bruce would have felt moved
to make a friend of Shepherd, but the fact that they
were of the same blood haunted him like a nightmare.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>As the days went by, Bruce fell prey to a mood common
to sensitive men in which he craved talk with a
woman—a woman of understanding. It was Saturday
and the office closed at noon. He would ask Millicent
to share his freedom in a drive into the country; and
without giving himself time to debate the matter, he
made haste to call her on the telephone.</p>

<p>Her voice responded cheerily. Leila had just broken
an engagement with her for golf and wouldn’t he play?
When he explained that he wasn’t a member of a club
and the best he could do for her would be to take her
to a public course, she declared that he must be her
guest. The point was too trivial for discussion; the
sooner they started the better, and so two o’clock found<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
them both with a good initial drive on the Faraway
course.</p>

<p>“Long drives mean long talks,” she said. “We begin
at least with the respect of our caddies. You’ll never
guess what I was doing when you called up!”</p>

<p>“At the organ, or in the studio putting a nose on
somebody?”</p>

<p>“Wrong! I was planting tulip bulbs. This was a
day when I couldn’t have played a note or touched clay
to save my life. Ever have such fits?”</p>

<p>“I certainly do,” replied Bruce.</p>

<p>Each time he saw her she was a little different—today
he was finding her different indeed from the girl
who had played for him, and yet not the girl of his
adventure on the river or the Millicent he had met at
the Country Club party. There was a charm in her
variableness, perhaps because of her habitual sincerity
and instinctive kindness. He waited for her to
putt and rolled his own ball into the cup.</p>

<p>“Sometimes I see things black; and then again there
<i>does</i> appear to be blue sky,” he said.</p>

<p>“Yes; but that’s not a serious symptom. If we didn’t
have those little mental experiences we wouldn’t be
interesting to ourselves!”</p>

<p>“Great Scott! <i>Must</i> we be interesting to ourselves?”</p>

<p>“Absolutely!”</p>

<p>“But when I’m down in the mouth I don’t care
whether I’m interesting or not!”</p>

<p>“Nothing in it! Life’s full of things to do—you
know that! I believe you’re just trying to psychoanalyze
me!”</p>

<p>“I swear I’m not! I was in the depths this morning;
that’s why I called you up!”</p>

<p>“Now——” She carefully measured a short approach
and played it neatly. “Oh, you didn’t want to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
see me socially, so to speak; you just wanted someone
to tell your troubles to! Is that a back-handed compliment?”</p>

<p>“Rather a confession—do you hate it?”</p>

<p>“No—I rather like that.”</p>

<p>With an artistic eye she watched him drive a long
low ball with his brassie. His tall figure, the free play
of arms and shoulders, his boyish smile when she
praised the shot, contributed to a new impression of
him. He appeared younger than the night he called on
her, when she had thought him diffident, old-fashioned
and stiffly formal.</p>

<p>As they walked over the turf with a misty drizzle
wetting their faces fitfully it seemed to both that their
acquaintance had just begun. When he asked if she
didn’t want to quit she protested that she was dressed
for any weather. It was unnecessary to accommodate
himself to her in any way; she walked as rapidly as
he; when she sliced her ball into the rough she bade
him not follow her, and when she had gotten into the
course again she ran to join him, as though eager not
to break the thread of their talk. The thing she was
doing at a given moment was, he judged, the one thing
in the world that interested her. The wind rose presently
and blew the mist away and there was promise
of a clearing sky.</p>

<p>“You’ve brought the sun back!” he exclaimed.
“Something told me you had influence with the
weather.”</p>

<p>“I haven’t invoked any of my gods today; so it’s just
happened.”</p>

<p>“Your gods! You speak as though you had a list!”</p>

<p>“Good gracious! You promised me once not to pick
me up and make me explain myself.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>“Then I apologize. I can see that it isn’t fair to
make a goddess explain her own divinity.”</p>

<p>“Oh-o-o-o,” she mocked him. “You get zero for
that!”</p>

<p>She was walking along with her hands thrust into
the pockets of her sweater, the brim of her small sport
hat turned up above her face.</p>

<p>“But seriously,” she went on, “out of doors is the
best place to think of God. The churches make religion
seem so complicated. We can’t believe in a God
we can’t imagine. Where there’s sky and grass it’s all
so much simpler. The only God I can feel is a spirit
hovering all about, watching and loving us—the God
of the Blue Horizons. I can’t think of Him as a being
whose name must be whispered as children whisper of
terrifying things in the dark.”</p>

<p>“The God of the Blue Horizons?” He repeated the
phrase slowly. “Yes; the world has had its day of fear—anything
that lifts our eyes to the blue sky is good—really
gives us, I suppose, a sense of the reality of
God....”</p>

<p>They had encountered few other players, but a foursome
was now approaching them where the lines of the
course paralleled.</p>

<p>“Constance Mills and George Whitford; I don’t
know the others,” said Millicent.</p>

<p>Mrs. Mills waved her hand and started toward them,
looking very fit in a smart sport suit. Idly twirling
her driver, she had hardly the air of a zealous golfer.</p>

<p>“Ah!” she exclaimed. “Aren’t we the brave ones?
Scotch blood! Not afraid of a little moisture. Mr.
Storrs! I know now why you’ve never been to see
me—you’re better occupied. It’s dreadful to be an old
married woman. You see what happens, Millicent!
I warn you solemnly against marriage. Yes, George—I’m<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
coming. Nice to meet you, even by chance, Mr.
Storrs. By-by, Millie.”</p>

<p>“You’ve displeased her ladyship,” Millicent remarked.
“You ought to go to see her.”</p>

<p>“I haven’t felt strongly moved,” Bruce replied.</p>

<p>“She doesn’t like being ignored. Of course nobody
does, but Mrs. Mills demands to be amused.”</p>

<p>“Is she being amused now?” Bruce asked.</p>

<p>“I wish Leila could have heard that!”</p>

<p>“Doesn’t Leila like her sister-in-law?”</p>

<p>“Yes, of course she does, but Constance is called the
most beautiful and the best dressed woman in town
and the admiration she gets goes to her head a little
bit. George Whitford seems to admire her tremendously.
Leila has a sense of humor that sees right
through Constance’s poses.”</p>

<p>“Doesn’t Leila pose just a little herself?”</p>

<p>“You might say that she does. Just now she’s
affecting the fast young person pose; but I think she’s
about through with it. She’s really the finest girl alive,
but she kids herself with the idea that she’s an awful
devil. Her whole crowd are affected by the same bug.”</p>

<p>“I rather guessed that,” said Bruce. “Let me see—was
that five for you?”</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>When they reached the clubhouse Millicent proposed
that they go home for the tea which alone could fittingly
conclude the afternoon. The moment they entered
the Harden hall she lifted her arms dramatically.</p>

<p>“Jumbles!” she cried in a mockery of delight.
“Mother has been making jumbles! Come straight to
the kitchen!”</p>

<p>In the kitchen they found Mrs. Harden, her ample<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
figure enveloped in a gingham apron of bright yellow
checks that seemed to fill the immaculate white kitchen
with color. Bruce was a little dismayed by his sudden
precipitation into the culinary department of
the establishment. Millicent began piling a plate with
warm jumbles; a maid appeared and began getting the
tea things ready. Mrs. Harden, her face aglow from
its recent proximity to the gas range, explained to
Bruce that it was the cook’s afternoon out and at such
times she always liked to cook something just to keep
her hand in. She was proud of the kitchen with its
white-tiled walls and flooring and glittering utensils.
The library and the organ belonged to Millie, she said,
but Doctor Harden had given her free swing to satisfy
her own craving for an up-to-date kitchen.</p>

<p>Bruce’s heart warmed under these revelations of
the domestic sanctuary. Mrs. Harden’s motherliness
seemed to embrace the world and her humor and sturdy
common sense were strongly evident. She regaled Bruce
with a story of a combat she had lately enjoyed with a
plumber. She warned him that if he would succeed as
an architect he must be firm with plumbers.</p>

<p>Alone in the living-room with their tea, Millicent
and Bruce continued to find much to discuss. She
was gay and serious by turns, made him talk of himself,
and finding that this evidently was distasteful to
him, she led the way back to impersonal things again.</p>

<p>“Why go when there will be dinner here pretty
soon?” she asked when he rose.</p>

<p>“Because I want to come back sometime! I want
some more jumbles! It’s been a great afternoon for
me. I do like the atmosphere of this house—kitchen
and everything. And the outdoors was fine—and
you——”</p>

<p>“I hoped you’d remember I was part of the scenery!”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>“I couldn’t forget it if I wanted to—and I don’t!
Do you suppose we could do it all over again—sometime
when you’re not terribly busy?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ll try to bear another afternoon with you!”</p>

<p>“Or we might do a theater or a movie?”</p>

<p>“Even that is possible.”</p>

<p>He didn’t know that she was exerting herself to
send him away cheerful. When he said soberly, his
hand on the door, “You don’t know how much you’ve
helped me,” she held up her finger warningly.</p>

<p>“Not so serious! Always cheerful!—that’s the
watchword!”</p>

<p>“All right! You may have to say that pretty often.”</p>

<p>Her light laugh, charged with friendliness, followed
him down the steps. She had made him forget himself,
lifted him several times to heights he had never
known before. He was sorry that he had not asked her
further about the faith to which she had confessed, her
God of the Blue Horizons. The young women he had
known were not given to such utterances,—certainly
not while playing very creditable golf! Her phrase
added majesty to the universe, made the invisible God
intelligible and credible. He felt that he could never
again look at the heavens without recalling that phrase
of hers. It wakened in him the sense of a need that he
had never known before. It was as if she had interpreted
some baffling passage in a mysterious book and
clarified it. He must see her again; yes, very often he
must see her.</p>

<p>But on his way home a dark thought crossed his
mind: “<i>What would Millicent say if she knew?</i>”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER EIGHT</h2>
</div>


<h3>I</h3>

<p>Two weeks later Bud Henderson sought Bruce at
Freeman’s office. Bruce looked up from his desk with
a frown that cleared as he recognized his friend. With
his cap pushed back on his head and buttoned up in a
long ulster, Henderson eyed him stolidly and demanded
to know what he was doing.</p>

<p>“Going over some specifications; I might say I’m at
work, if you knew what the word means.”</p>

<p>“Thanks for the compliment, but it’s time to quit,”
Henderson replied, taking a cigarette from a package
on Bruce’s desk. “I happen to know your boss is playing
handball this moment at the Athletic and he’ll
never know you’ve skipped. I haven’t liked a certain
look in your eye lately. You’re sticking too close to
your job. Bill is pleased to death with your work, so
you haven’t a thing to worry about. Get your bonnet
and we’ll go out and see what we can stir up.”</p>

<p>“I’m in a frame of mind to be tempted. But I ought
to finish this stuff.”</p>

<p>“Don’t be silly,” replied Bud, who was prowling
about the room viewing the framed plans and drawings
on the walls, peering into cabinets, unrolling blue prints
merely to fling them aside with a groan of disgust.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>“My God! It doesn’t seem possible that Bill Freeman
would put his name to such things!”</p>

<p>“Don’t forget this is a <i>private</i> office, Mr. Henderson.
What’s agitating your bean?”</p>

<p>“Thought I’d run you up to the art institute to look
at some Finnish work they’re showing. Perhaps it’s
Hottentotish; or maybe it’s Eskimo art. We’ve got to
keep in touch with the world art movement.” Henderson
yawned.</p>

<p>“Try again; I pant for real excitement,” said Bruce,
who was wondering whether his friend really had
noticed signs of his recent worry. Henderson, apparently
intent upon a volume of prints of English country
houses, swung round as Bruce, in putting on his overcoat,
knocked over a chair. He crossed the room and
laid his hands on Bruce’s broad shoulders.</p>

<p>“I say, old top; this will never do! You’re nervous;
you’re damned nervous. Knocking over chairs—and
you with the finest body known in modern times! I
watched you the other day eating your lunch all alone
at the club—you didn’t know I was looking at you.
Your expression couldn’t be accounted for even by that
bum club lunch. Now if it’s money——”</p>

<p>“Nothing of the kind, Bud!” Bruce protested.
“You’ll have me scared in a minute. There’s nothing
the matter with me. I’m all right; I just have to get
readjusted to a new way of living; that’s all.”</p>

<p>“Well, as you don’t thrill to the idea of viewing
works of art, I’ll tell you what I’m really here for. I’m
luring you away to sip tea with a widow!”</p>

<p>“A widow! Where do you get the idea that I’m a
consoler of widows?”</p>

<p>“This one doesn’t need consoling! Helen Torrence
is the name; relict of the late James B. deceased. She’s
been away ever since you lit in our midst and just got<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
home. About our age and not painful to look at. Jim
Torrence was a good fifty when he met her, at White
Sulphur or some such seat of opulence, and proudly
brought her home for local inspection. The gossips
forcibly removed most of her moral character, just on
suspicion, you understand—but James B.’s money had
a soothing effect and she got one foot inside our social
door before he passed hence three years ago and left
her the boodle he got from his first wife. Helen’s a
good scout. It struck me all of a heap about an hour
ago that she’s just the girl to cheer you up. I was
just kidding about the art stuff. I telephoned Helen
I was coming, so we’re all set.”</p>

<p>“Ah! I see through the whole game! You’re flirting
with the woman and want me for a blind in case
Maybelle finds you out.”</p>

<p>“Clever! The boy’s clever! But—listen—I never
try to put anything over on Maybelle. A grand jury
hasn’t an all-seeinger eye than Mrs. Bud Henderson.
Let’s beat it!”</p>

<p>On the drive uptown Henderson devoted himself
with his usual thoroughness to a recital of the history
of Mrs. Torrence. The lady’s social status lay somewhere
between the old and the new element, Bud explained.
The president of the trust company that administered
her affairs belonged to the old crowd—the
paralytic or angina pectoris group, as Bud described it,
and his wife and daughters just <i>had</i> to be nice to Torrence’s
wife or run a chance of offending her and
losing control of the estate. On the other hand her
natural gaiety threw her toward the camps of the
newer element who were too busy having a good time
to indulge in ancestor worship.</p>

<p>Henderson concluded his illuminative exposition of
Mrs. Torrence’s life history as they reached the house.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
They were admitted by a colored butler who took their
coats and flung open a door that revealed a spacious
living-room.</p>

<p>“Helen!” exclaimed Henderson dramatically.</p>

<p>It was possible that Mrs. Torrence had prepared for
their entrance by posing in the middle of the room with
a view to a first effect, an effect to which her quick little
step as she came forward to meet them contributed.
Her blue tea gown, parted a little above the ankles,
invited inspection of her remarkably small feet adorned
with brilliant buckles. She was short with a figure
rounded to plumpness and with fluffy brown hair,
caught up high as though to create an illusion as to
her stature. Her complexion was a clear brilliant pink;
her alert small eyes were a greenish blue. Her odd
little staccato walk was in keeping with her general
air of vivacity. She was all alive, amusingly abrupt,
spontaneous, decisive.</p>

<p>“Hello! Bud, the old reliable! Mr. Storrs! Yes;
I <i>had</i> been hoping for this!”</p>

<p>She gave a hand to each and looked up at Bruce, who
towered above her, and nodded as though approving
of him.</p>

<p>“This is delightful! A new man! Marvelous!”</p>

<p>As she explained that she had been away since June
and was only just home, Bruce became aware that
Henderson had passed on and was standing by a tea table
indulging in his usual style of raillery with a
young woman whose voice even before he looked at her
identified her as Constance Mills.</p>

<p>“You know Mrs. Mills? Of course! If you’d only
arrived this morning you’d know Connie. Not to know
Connie is indeed to be unknown.”</p>

<p>Constance extended her hand from the divan on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
which she was seated behind the tea table—thrust it
out lazily with a minimum of effort.</p>

<p>“Oh—the difficult Mr. Storrs! I’m terribly mortified
to be meeting you in a friend’s house and not in
my own!”</p>

<p>“To meet you anywhere——” began Bruce, but she
interrupted him, holding him with her eyes.</p>

<p>“——would be a pleasure! Of course! I know the
formula, but I’m not a debutante. You didn’t like me
that night we met at Dale Freeman’s, and I was foolish
enough to think I’d made an impression!”</p>

<p>“Let’s tell him the truth,” said Henderson, helping
himself to a slice of cinnamon toast. “Bruce, I bet a
hundred cigarettes with Connie I could deliver you
here and I win!”</p>

<p>“Not a word of truth in that!” declared Constance.
“Bud’s such a liar!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Torrence said they must have tea, and Henderson
protested that tea was not to be thought of. Tea,
he declared, was extremely distasteful to him; and
Bruce always became ill at the sight of it.</p>

<p>“But when I told Connie you were bringing Mr.
Storrs she said he was terribly proper and for me not
to dare mention cocktails.”</p>

<p>“Now, Helen, I didn’t say just that! What I meant,
of course, was that I hoped that Mr. Storrs wasn’t too
proper,” said Constance.</p>

<p>“Proper!” Bruce caught her up. “This is an enemy’s
work. Bud, I suspect you of this dastardly assault
on my character!”</p>

<p>“Not guilty!” Bud retorted. “The main thing right
now is that we’re all peevish and need martinis. What’s
the Volstead signal, Helen?”</p>

<p>“Three rings, Bud, with a pause between the first
and second.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>The tea tray was removed and reappeared adorned
with all the essentials for the concoction of cocktails.
When the glasses were filled and all had expressed
their satisfaction at the result, Henderson detained the
negro butler for a conference on dice throwing. He
seated himself on the floor the better to receive the
man’s instructions. The others taunted him for his
inaptitude. The butler retired finally with five dollars
of Bud’s money, a result attained only after the spectators
were limp with laughter.</p>

<p>“You’re a scream, Bud! A perfect scream!” and
Mrs. Torrence refilled the glasses.</p>

<p>She took Bud to the dining-room to exhibit a rare
Japanese screen acquired in her travels, and Bruce
found himself alone with Constance. She pointed to
her glass, still brimming, and remarked:</p>

<p>“Please admire my abstemiousness! One is my
limit.”</p>

<p>“Let me see; did I really have three?” asked Bruce
as he sat down beside her.</p>

<p>“I want to forget everything this afternoon,” she
began. “I feel that I’d like to climb the hills of the
unattainable, be someone else for a while.”</p>

<p>“Oh, we all have those spells,” he replied. “That’s
why Prohibition’s a failure.”</p>

<p>“But life is a bore at times,” she insisted. “Maybe
you’re one of the lucky ones who never go clear down.
A man has his work—there’s always that——”</p>

<p>“Hasn’t woman got herself everything—politics,
business, philanthropy? You don’t mean to tell me the
new woman is already pining for her old slavery! I
supposed you led a complete and satisfactory existence!”</p>

<p>“A pretty delusion! I just pretend, that’s all. There
are days when nothing seems of the slightest use. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
thought there might be something in politics, but after
I’d gone to a few meetings and served on a committee
or two it didn’t amuse me any more. I played at being
a radical for a while, but after you’ve scared all your
friends a few times with your violence it ceases to be
funny. The only real joy I got out of flirting with
socialism was in annoying my father-in-law. And I
had to give that up for fear he’d think I was infecting
Shep with my ideas.”</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>A tinge of malice was perceptible in her last words,
but she smiled instantly to relieve the embarrassment
she detected in his face. He was not sure just how
she wanted him to take her. The unhappiness she had
spoken of he assumed to be only a pose with her—something
to experiment with upon men she met on gray
afternoons in comfortable houses over tea and cocktails.
Mrs. Shepherd Mills might be amusing, or she
might easily become a bore. The night he met her at
the Freemans’ he had thought her probably guileless
under her mask of sophistication. She was proving
more interesting than he had imagined, less obvious;
perhaps with an element of daring in her blood that
might one day get the better of her. She was quite as
handsome as he remembered her from the meeting at
the Freemans’ and she indubitably had mastered the
art of dressing herself becomingly.</p>

<p>He was watching the play of the shadow of her picture
hat on her face, seeking clues to her mood, vexed
that he had permitted himself to be brought into her
company, when she said:</p>

<p>“I’m not amusing you! Please forgive me. I can’t
help it if I’m a little <i>triste</i>. Some little devilish imp<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
is dancing through my silly head. If I took a second
glass——”</p>

<p>Bruce answered her look of inquiry with a shake
of the head.</p>

<p>“Are you asking my advice? I positively refuse to
give it; but if you command me, of course——”</p>

<p>He rose, took the glass, and held it high for her
inspection.</p>

<p>“The man tempts me——” she said pensively.</p>

<p>“The man doesn’t tempt you. We’ll say it’s the little
imp. Mrs. Mills, do you want this cocktail or do you
not?”</p>

<p>“It might cheer me up a little. I don’t want you to
think me stupid; I know I’m terribly dull!”</p>

<p>She drank half the cocktail and bade him finish it.</p>

<p>“Oh, certainly!” he replied and drained the glass.
“Now, under the additional stimulus, we can proceed
with the discussion. What were we talking about, anyhow?”</p>

<p>“It doesn’t matter. Life offers plenty of problems.
How many people do you really think are happy—really
happy? Now Bud’s always cheerful; he and
Maybelle are happy—remarkably so, I think. Helen
Torrence—well, I hesitate to say whether she’s really
happy or not; she always appears gay, just as you see
her today; and it’s something to be able to give the
impression, whether it’s false or not.”</p>

<p>“Yes; it’s well to make a front,” Bruce replied, determined
to keep a frivolous tone with her. “The
Freemans enjoy themselves; they’re quite ideally mated,
I’d say.”</p>

<p>“Yes, they’re making a success of their lives. Dale
and Bill are always cheerful. Now there’s dear old
Shep——”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>“Well, of course he’s happy. How could he be
otherwise?”</p>

<p>“You’re not taking me seriously at all! I’m disappointed.
I was terribly blue today; that’s why I
plotted with Bud to get you here—I shamelessly confess
that I want to know you better.”</p>

<p>“Come now! You’re just kidding!”</p>

<p>“You’re incorrigible. I’m that rarest of beings—a
frank woman. You refuse to come to my house, presumably
because you don’t like me, so I have to trap
you here.”</p>

<p>“How you misjudge me! I haven’t been around because
I’ve been busy; I belong to the toiling masses!”</p>

<p>“You have time for Miss Harden; you two seemed
ever so chummy on the golf course. Of course, I can’t
compete with Millie—she’s so beautiful and so artistic—so
many accomplishments. But you ought to be considerate
of a poor thing like me. I’m only sorry I
have so little to offer. I really thought you would be a
nice playmate; but——”</p>

<p>“A playmate? Aren’t we playing now?—at least
you are playing with me!”</p>

<p>“Am I?” she asked.</p>

<p>She bent toward him with a slight, an almost imperceptible
movement of her shoulders, and her lips parted
tremulously in a wistful smile of many connotations.
She was not without her charms; she was a very pretty
woman; and there was nothing vulgar in her manner
of exercising her charms. Bruce touched her hand,
gently clasped it—a slender, cool hand. She made no
attempt to release it; and it lay lingering and acquiescent
in his clasp. He raised it and kissed the finger
tips.</p>

<p>“You really understand me; I knew you would,” she
murmured. “It’s terrible to be lonely. And you are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
so big and strong; you can help me if you will——”</p>

<p>“I have no right to help you,” he said. “It’s part
of the game in this funny world that we’ve got to help
ourselves.”</p>

<p>“But if you knew I needed you——”</p>

<p>“Ah, but you don’t!” he replied.</p>

<p>Bud tiptoed in with a tray containing highball materials
and placed it on the tea table. He urged them in
eloquent pantomime to drink themselves to death and
tiptoed out again. Bruce, wondering if he dared leave,
hoped the interruption would serve to change the current
of his talk with Constance, when she said:</p>

<p>“Shep speaks of you often; he likes you and really
Shep’s ever so interesting.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” Bruce answered, “he has ideas and ideals—really
thinks about things in a fine way.”</p>

<p>He did not care to discuss Shepherd Mills with Shepherd’s
wife, even when, presumably, she was merely
making talk to create an atmosphere of intimacy.</p>

<p>“Shep isn’t a cut-up,” she went on, “and he doesn’t
know how to be a good fellow with men of his own
age. And he’s so shy he’s afraid of the older men.
And his father—you’ve met Mr. Mills? Well, Shep
doesn’t seem able to get close to his father.”</p>

<p>“That happens, of course, between fathers and sons,”
Bruce replied. “Mr. Mills——”</p>

<p>He paused, took a cigarette from his case and put it
back. He was by turns perplexed, annoyed, angry and
afraid—afraid that he might in some way betray himself.</p>

<p>“Mr. Mills is a curious person,” Constance went on.
“He seems to me like a man who lives alone in a formal
garden with high walls on four sides and has
learned to ignore the roar of the world outside—a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
prisoner who carries the key of his prison-house but
can’t find the lock!”</p>

<p>Bruce bent his head toward her, intent upon her
words. He hadn’t thought her capable of anything so
imaginative. Some reply was necessary; he would
make another effort to get rid of a subject that both
repelled and fascinated him.</p>

<p>“I suppose we’re all born free; if we find ourselves
shut in it’s because we’ve built the walls ourselves.”</p>

<p>“How about my prison-house?” she asked. “Do you
suppose I can ever escape?”</p>

<p>“Why should you? Don’t you like your garden?”</p>

<p>“Not always; no! It’s a little stifling sometimes!”</p>

<p>“Then push the walls back a little! It’s a good sign,
isn’t it, when we begin to feel cramped?”</p>

<p>“You’re doing a lot better! I begin to feel more
hopeful about you. You really could be a great consolation
to me if—if you weren’t so busy!”</p>

<p>“I really did appreciate your invitation. I’ll be
around very soon.”</p>

<p>After all, he decided, she was only flirting with him;
her confidences were only a means of awakening his
interest, stirring his sympathy. She had probably
never loved Shepherd, but she respected his high-mindedness
and really wanted to help him. The depression
to which she confessed was only the common ennui of
her class and type; she needed occupation, doubtless
children would solve her problem to some extent. Her
life ran too smooth a course, and life was not meant to
be like that....</p>

<p>He was impatient to leave, but Mrs. Torrence and
Henderson had started a phonograph and were dancing
in the hall. Constance seemed unmindful of the noise
they were making.</p>

<p>“Shall we join in that romp?” asked Bruce.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>“Thanks, no—if you don’t mind! I suppose it’s
really time to run along. May I fix a drink for you?
It’s too bad to go away and leave all that whisky!”</p>

<p>The music stopped in the midst of a jazzy saxophone
wail and Mrs. Torrence and Henderson were
heard noisily greeting several persons who had just
come in.</p>

<p>“It’s Leila,” said Constance, rising and glancing at
the clock. “She has no business being here at this time
of day.”</p>

<p>“Hello, Connie! Got a beau?”</p>

<p>Leila peered into the room, struck her hands together
and called over her shoulder:</p>

<p>“Come in, lads! See what’s here! Red liquor as I
live and breathe! Oh, Mr. What’s-your-name——”</p>

<p>“Mr. Storrs,” Constance supplied.</p>

<p>“Oh, of course! Mr. Storrs—Mr. Thomas and Mr.
Whitford!”</p>

<p>Bruce had heard much of Whitford at the University
Club, where he was one of the most popular members.
He had won fame as an athlete in college and
was a polo player of repute. A cosmopolitan by nature,
he had traveled extensively and in the Great War had
won honorable distinction. Having inherited money
he was able to follow his own bent. It was whispered
that he entertained literary ambitions. He was one of
the chief luminaries of the Dramatic Club, coached the
players and had produced several one-act plays of his
own that had the flavor of reality. He was of medium
height and looked the soldier and athlete. Women had
done much to spoil him, but in spite of his preoccupation
with society, men continued to like George, who
was a thoroughly good fellow and a clean sportsman.</p>

<p>Whitford entered at once into a colloquy with Constance.
Thomas, having expressed his pleasure at meeting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
Bruce, was explaining to Mrs. Torrence how he and
Whitford had met Leila downtown.</p>

<p>“Liar!” exclaimed Leila, who was pouring herself a
drink. “You did nothing of the kind. We met at the
Burtons’ and Nellie gave us a little drink—just a
tweeney, stingy little drink.”</p>

<p>The drink she held up for purposes of illustration
was not infinitesimal. Mrs. Torrence said that everyone
must have a highball and proceeded to prepare a
drink for Thomas and Whitford.</p>

<p>“You and Connie are certainly the solemn owls,” she
remarked to Bruce. “Anyone would have thought you
were holding a funeral in here. Say when, Fred. This
is real Bourbon that Jim had for years. You’ll never
see anything like it.”</p>

<p>“Bruce,” cried Henderson, “has Connie filled you
with gloom? She gets that way sometimes, but it
doesn’t mean anything. A little of this stuff will set
you up. This bird, Storrs, always did have glass legs,”
he explained to Thomas; “he can drink gallons and be
ready to converse with bishops. Never saw such a
capacity! If I get a few more Maybelle will certainly
hand it to me when I get home.”</p>

<p>Constance walked round the table to Leila, who had
drunk a glass of the Bourbon to sample it and, satisfied
of its quality, was now preparing a highball.</p>

<p>“No more, Leila!” said Constance, in a low tone.
The girl drew back defiantly.</p>

<p>“Go away, Connie! I need just one more.”</p>

<p>“You had more than you needed at the Burtons’.
Please, Leila, be sensible. Helen, send the tray away.”</p>

<p>“Leila’s all right!” said Thomas, but at a sign from
Mrs. Torrence he picked up the tray and carried it out.</p>

<p>“I don’t think it pretty to treat me as though I were
shot when I’m not,” said Leila petulantly. She walked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
to the end of the room and sat down with the injured
air of a rebellious child.</p>

<p>“Leila, do you know what time it is?” demanded
Constance. “Your father’s having a dinner and you’ve
got to be there.”</p>

<p>“I’m going to be there! There’s loads of time.
Everybody sit down and be comfortable!” Leila composedly
sipped her glass as though to set an example to
the others. Thomas had come back and Constance
said a few words to him in a low tone.</p>

<p>“Oh, shucks! I know what you’re saying. Connie’s
telling you to take me home,” said Leila. She turned
her wrist to look at her watch—frowned in the effort
of focusing upon it and added with a shrug: “There’s
all the time in the world. If you people think you
can scare me you’ve got another guess coming. It’s
just ten minutes of six; dinner’s at seven-thirty! I’ve
got to rest a little. You all look so ridiculous standing
there glaring at me. I’m no white mouse with pink
eyes!”</p>

<p>“Really, dear,” said Mrs. Torrence coaxingly, walking
toward Leila with her hands outstretched much as
though she were trying to make friends with a reluctant
puppy. “Do run along home like a good girl!”</p>

<p>Leila apparently had no intention of running along
home like a good little girl. She dropped her glass—empty—and
without warning caught the astounded
lady tightly about the neck.</p>

<p>“Step-mother! Dear, nice step-mamma!” she cried.
“Nice, dear, sweet, kind step-mamma! Helen’s going
to be awful good to poor little Leila. Helen not be
bad step-mamma like story books; Helen be sweet, kind
step-mamma and put nice, beautiful gin cocktails in
baby’s bottle!”</p>

<p>As she continued in cooing tones Leila stroked her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
captive’s cheek and kissed her with a mockery of tenderness.
Henderson and Thomas were shouting with
laughter; Constance viewed the scene with lofty disdain;
Whitford was mildly amused; Bruce, wishing
himself somewhere else, withdrew toward the door,
prepared to leave at the earliest possible moment.
When at last Mrs. Torrence freed herself she sank into
a chair and her laughter attained a new pitch of
shrillness.</p>

<p>“Leila, you’ll be the death of me!” she gasped when
her mirth had spent itself.</p>

<p>“Leila will be the death of all of us,” announced
Constance solemnly.</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know!” said Leila, straightening her
hat composedly at the mantel mirror.</p>

<p>“Too bad Leila’s ‘step-mama’ couldn’t have heard
that!” sighed Henderson.</p>

<p>“Now, Leila,” said Constance severely, “do run
along home. Please let me take you in my car; you
oughtn’t to drive in the condition you’re in.”</p>

<p>The remark was not fortunate. Leila had discovered
a box of bonbons and was amusing herself by
tossing them into the air and trying to catch them in
her mouth. She scored one success in three attempts
and curtsied to an imaginary audience.</p>

<p>“My condition!” she said, with fine scorn. “I wish
you wouldn’t speak as though I were a common drunk!”</p>

<p>“Anyone can see that you’re not fit to go home.
Your father will be furious.”</p>

<p>“Not if I tell him I’ve been with you!” Leila flung
back.</p>

<p>“Say, Leila!” began Henderson, ingratiatingly.
“We’re old pals, you and I—let’s shake this bunch.
I’ll do something nice for you sometime.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>“What will you do?” Leila demanded with provoking
deliberation.</p>

<p>“Oh, something mighty nice! Maybelle and I will
give you a party and you can name the guests.”</p>

<p>“Stupid!” she yawned. “Your hair’s mussed, Helen.
You and Bud have been naughty.”</p>

<p>“Your behavior isn’t ladylike,” said Thomas. “The
party’s getting rough! Come on, let’s go.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m misbehaving, am I? Well, I guess my
conduct’s as good as yours! Where do you get this
stuff that I’m a lost lamb? Even an expert like you,
Freddy, wouldn’t call me soused. I’m just little bit
tipsy—that’s all! If I had a couple more highballs——”</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>By a signal passed from one to the other they began
feigning to ignore her. Constance said she was going;
Bud, Whitford and Thomas joined Bruce at the door
where he was saying good-night to Mrs. Torrence.
Leila was not so tipsy but that she understood what
they were doing.</p>

<p>“Think you can freeze me out, do you? Well, I’m
not so easily friz! Mr. What’s-your-name——” She
fixed her eyes upon Bruce detainingly.</p>

<p>“Storrs,” Bruce supplied good-naturedly.</p>

<p>“You’re the only lady or gentleman in this room.
I’m going to ask you to take me home!”</p>

<p>“Certainly, Miss Mills!”</p>

<p>With a queenly air she took his arm. Henderson
ran forward and opened the door, the others hanging
back, silent, afraid to risk a word that might reopen
the discussion and delay her departure.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>“Shall I drive?” Bruce asked when they reached the
curb.</p>

<p>“Yes, thanks; if you don’t mind.”</p>

<p>“Home?” he inquired as he got her car under way.</p>

<p>“I was just doing a little thinking,” she said deliberatingly.
“It will take only five minutes to run over to
that little cafeteria on Fortieth Street. Some coffee
wouldn’t be a bad thing; and would you mind turning
the windshield—I’d like the air.”</p>

<p>“A good idea,” said Bruce, and stepped on the gas.
The car had been built for Leila’s special use and he
had with difficulty squeezed himself into the driver’s
seat; but he quickly caught the hang of it. He stopped
a little beyond the cafeteria to avoid the lights of the
busy corner and brought out a container of hot coffee
and paper cups.</p>

<p>“Like a picnic, isn’t it?” she said. “You won’t join
me?”</p>

<p>She sipped the coffee slowly while he stood in the
street beside her.</p>

<p>“There!” she said. “Thank you, ever so much.
Quarter of seven? Forty-five minutes to dress! Just
shoot right along home now. Would you mind driving
over to the boulevard and going in that way? The
air certainly feels good.”</p>

<p>“Nothing would please me more,” he said, giving her
a quick inspection as they passed under the lights at a
cross-street. She was staring straight ahead, looking
singularly young as she lay back with her hands clasped
in her lap.</p>

<p>“Constance was furious!” she said suddenly. “Well,
I suppose she had a right to be. I had no business
getting lit.”</p>

<p>“Well, strictly speaking, you shouldn’t do it,” he
said. It was not the time nor place and he was not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
the proper person to lecture her upon her delinquencies.
But he had not been displeased that she chose
him to take her home, even though the choice was only
a whim.</p>

<p>“You must think me horrid! This is the second
time you’ve seen me teed up too high.”</p>

<p>“I’ve seen a lot of other people teed up much higher!
You’re perfectly all right now?”</p>

<p>“Absolutely! That coffee fixed me; I’m beginning
to feel quite bully. I can go home now and jump
into my joy rags and nobody will ever be the wiser.
This is an old folks’ party, but Dada always wants to
exhibit me when he feeds the nobility—can you see
me?”</p>

<p>Her low laugh was entirely reassuring as to her
sobriety, and he was satisfied that she would be able
to give a good account of herself at her father’s table.</p>

<p>“Just leave the car on the drive,” she said as they
reached the house. “Maybe I can crawl up to my room
without Dada knowing I’m late. I’m a selfish little
brute—to be leaving you here stranded! Well, thanks
awfully!”</p>

<p>He walked with her to the entrance and she was
taking out her key when Mills, in his evening clothes,
opened the door.</p>

<p>“Leila! You’re late!” he exclaimed sharply. “Where
on earth have you been?”</p>

<p>“Just gadding about, as usual! But I’m in plenty
of time, Dada. Please thank Mr. Storrs for coming
home with me. Good-night and thank you some
more!”</p>

<p>She darted into the house, leaving Bruce confronting
her father.</p>

<p>“Oh, Mr. Storrs!” The emphasis on the name was
eloquent of Mills’s surprise that Bruce was on his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
threshold. Bruce had decided that any explanations
required were better left to Leila, who was probably
an adept in explanations. He was about to turn away
when Mills stepped outside.</p>

<p>“We’re entertaining tonight,” he said pleasantly. “I
was a little afraid something had happened to my
daughter.”</p>

<p>A certain dignity of utterance marked his last words—my
daughter. He threw into the phrase every possible
suggestion of paternal pride.</p>

<p>Bruce, halfway down the steps, paused until Mills
had concluded his remark. Then lifting his hat with a
murmured good-night, he hurried toward the gate. An
irresistible impulse caused him to look back. Mills
remained just inside the entry, his figure clearly defined
by the overhead lights, staring toward the street. Seeing
Bruce look back, he went quickly into the house
and the heavy door boomed upon him.</p>

<p>Bruce walked to the nearest street car line and rode
downtown for dinner. The fact that Mills was waiting
at the door for his daughter was not without its significance,
hinting at a constant uneasiness for her safety
beyond ordinary parental solicitude. What Constance
had said that afternoon about Mills came back to him.
He was oppressed by a sense of something tragic in
Mills’s life—the tragedy of a failure that wore outwardly
the guise of success.</p>

<p>In spite of a strong effort of will to obliterate these
thoughts he found his memory dragging into his consciousness
odd little pictures of Mills—fragmentary
snapshots, more vivid and haunting than complete portraits:
the look Mills gave him the first time they met
at the Country Club; Mills’s shoulders and the white
line of his collar above his dinner coat as he left the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
Hardens’; and now the quick change from irritation to
relief and amiable courtesy when he admitted Leila.</p>

<p>Henderson and Millicent and now today Constance
had given him hints of Mills’s character, and Bruce
found himself trying to reconcile and unify their comments
and fit them into his own inferences and conclusions.
The man was not without his fascinations
as a subject for analysis. Behind that gracious exterior
there must be another identity either less noble
or finer than the man the world knew.... Before
he slept, Bruce found it necessary to combat an apprehension
that, if he continued to hear Mills dissected
and analyzed, he might learn to pity the man.</p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>That evening when Shepherd Mills went home he
found Constance seated at her dressing table, her heavy
golden-brown hair piled loosely upon her head, while
her maid rubbed cold cream into her throat and face.
She espied him in the mirror and greeted him with a
careless, “Hello, Shep. How did the day go with
you?”—the question employed by countless American
wives in saluting their husbands at the end of a toilsome
day.</p>

<p>“Oh, pretty good!” he replied. No husband ever
admits that a day has been wholly easy and prosperous.</p>

<p>She put out her hand for him to kiss and bade him
sit down beside her. He was always diffident before
the mysteries of his wife’s toilet. He glanced at the
gown laid across a chair and surveyed the crystal and
silver on the dressing table with a confused air as
though he had never seen them before.</p>

<p>The room denoted Constance Mills’s love of luxury,
and incidentally her self-love. The walls on two sides<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
were set in mirrors that reached from ceiling to floor.
The furniture, the rugs, the few pictures, the window
draperies had been chosen with an exquisite care and
combined in an evocation of the spirit of indolence.
There was a much be-pillowed divan across one corner,
so placed that when she enjoyed a siesta Constance
could contemplate herself in the mirrors opposite.
Scents—a mingling of faint exotic odors—hung upon
the air.</p>

<p>She was quick to note that something was on Shepherd’s
mind and half from curiosity, half in a spirit
of kindness, dismissed the maid as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>“You can hook me up, Shep. I’ll do my hair myself.
I won’t need you any more, Marie. Yes—my
blue cloak. Now, little boy, go ahead and tell me
what’s bothering you.”</p>

<p>Shepherd frowned and twisted his mustache as he
sat huddled on the divan.</p>

<p>“It’s about father; nothing new, just our old failure
to understand each other. It’s getting worse. I
never know where I stand with him.”</p>

<p>“Well, does anyone?” Constance asked serenely.
“You really mustn’t let him get on your nerves. There
are things you’ve got to take because we all do; but by
studying him a little and practicing a little patience
you’ll escape a lot of worry.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” he assented eagerly. “You know he just pretends
that I’m the head of the plant; Fields is the real
authority there. It’s not the president but the vice-president
who has the say about things. Father consults
Fields constantly. He doesn’t trust me—I’m just
a figurehead.”</p>

<p>“Fields is such an ass,” remarked Constance with a
shrug of her shapely shoulders. “An utterly impossible
person. Why not just let him do all the explaining<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
to your father? If any mistakes are made at the
plant, then it’s on him.”</p>

<p>“But that’s not the way of it,” Shepherd protested
plaintively. “He gets the praise; I get the blame.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, you can’t make your father over. You
ought to be glad you’re not of his hard-boiled variety.
You’re human, Sheppy, and that’s better than being a
magnificent iceberg.”</p>

<p>“Father doesn’t see things; he doesn’t realize that
the world’s changing,” Shepherd went on stubbornly.
“He doesn’t see that the old attitude toward labor
won’t do any more.”</p>

<p>“He’ll never see it,” said Constance. “Things like
that don’t hit him at all. He’s like those silly people
who didn’t know there was anything wrong in France
till their necks were in the guillotine.”</p>

<p>“I told you about that clubhouse I wanted to build
for our people on the Milton farm? I hate to give
that up. It would mean so much to those people. And
he was all wrong in thinking it would injure the property.
I think it’s only decent to do something for
them.”</p>

<p>“Well, how can you do it without your father?” she
asked, shifting herself for a better scrutiny of her head
in the mirror.</p>

<p>“You know that little tract of land—about twenty
acres, back of the plant? I could buy that and put the
clubhouse there. I have some stock in the Rogers
Trust Company I can sell—about two hundred shares.
It came to me through mother’s estate. Father has
nothing to do with it. The last quotation on it is two
hundred. What do you think of that?”</p>

<p>“Well, I think pretty well of it,” said Constance.
“Your father ought to let you build the clubhouse, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
he has a positive passion for making people uncomfortable.”</p>

<p>“I suppose,” continued Shepherd dubiously, “if I go
ahead and build the thing—even with my own money—he
would be angry. Of course there may be something
in his idea that if we do a thing of this kind it would
make the workmen at other plants restless——”</p>

<p>“Piffle!” exclaimed Constance. “That’s the regular
old stock whimper of the back-number. You might
just as well say that it would be a forward step other
employers ought to follow!”</p>

<p>“Yes, there’s that!” he agreed, his eyes brightening
at the suggestion.</p>

<p>“If you built the house on your own land the storage
battery company wouldn’t be responsible for it in
any way.”</p>

<p>“Certainly not!” Shepherd was increasingly pleased
that she saw it all so clearly.</p>

<p>She had slipped on her gown and was instructing
him as to the position of the hooks.</p>

<p>“No; the other side, Shep. That’s right. There’s
another bunch on the left shoulder. Now you’ve got
it! Thanks ever so much.”</p>

<p>He watched her admiringly as she paraded before
the mirrors to make sure that the skirt hung properly.</p>

<p>“If there’s to be a row——” he began as she opened
a drawer and selected a handkerchief.</p>

<p>“Let there be a row! My dear Shep, you’re always
too afraid of asserting yourself. What could he do?
He might get you up to his office and give you a bad
quarter of an hour; but he’d respect you more afterwards
if you stood to your guns. His vanity and
family pride protect you. Catch him doing anything
that might get him into the newspapers—not Franklin
Mills!”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>Relieved and encouraged by her understanding and
sympathy, he explained more particularly the location
of the property he proposed buying. It was quite as
convenient to the industrial colony that had grown up
about the storage battery plant as the Milton land his
father had declined to let him use. The land was
bound to appreciate in value, he said.</p>

<p>“What if it doesn’t!” exclaimed Constance with mild
scorn. “You’ll have been doing good with your money,
anyhow.”</p>

<p>“You think, then, you’d go ahead—sell the stock
and buy the land? It’s so late now, maybe I’d better
wait till spring?”</p>

<p>“That might be better, Shep, but use your own judgment.
You asked your father to help and he turned
you down. Your going ahead will have a good effect
on him. He needs a jar. Now run along and dress.
You’re going to be late for dinner.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know,” he said, rising and looking down at
her as she sat turning over the leaves of a book. “Connie——”</p>

<p>“Yes, Shep,” she murmured absently; and then, “Oh,
by the way, Shep, I was at Helen’s this afternoon.”</p>

<p>“Helen Torrence’s? What was it—a tea?”</p>

<p>“In a manner of speaking—tea! Dramatic Club
business. George Whitford was there—he’s concentrating
on theatricals. George is such a dear!”</p>

<p>“One of the best fellows in the world!” said Shep.</p>

<p>“He certainly is!” Constance affirmed.</p>

<p>“Connie——” he stammered and took her hand.
“Connie—you’re awfully good to me. You know I
love you——”</p>

<p>“Why, of course, you dear baby!” She lifted her
head with a quick, reassuring smile. “But for goodness’
sake run along and change your clothes!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span></p>


<h3>V</h3>

<p>When his guests had gone, Mills, as was his habit,
smoked a cigar and discussed the dinner with Leila.
He was aware that in asking her to join him on such
occasions of state he was subjecting her to a trying
ordeal, and tonight he was particularly well pleased
with her.</p>

<p>“They all enjoyed themselves, Dada; you needn’t
worry about that party!” Leila remarked, smoking the
cigarette she had denied herself while the guests remained.</p>

<p>“I think they did; thank you very much for helping
me.”</p>

<p>Leila had charm; he was always proud of an opportunity
to display her to her mother’s old friends, whose
names, like his own, carried weight in local history.
His son was a Shepherd; Leila, he persuaded himself,
was, with all her waywardness and little follies, more
like himself. Leila looked well at his table, and her
dramatic sense made it possible for her to act the rôle
of the daughter of the house with the formality that
was dear to him. Whenever he entertained he and
Leila received the guests together, standing in front of
Mrs. Mills’s portrait. People who dared had laughed
about this, speculating as to the probable fate of the
portrait in case Mills married again.</p>

<p>“I’d got nervous about you when you were so late
coming,” Mills was saying. “That’s how I came to
be at the door. I’d just called Millicent to see if you
were over there.”</p>

<p>“Foolish Dada! Don’t I always turn up?” she asked,
kicking off her slippers. “I’d been fooling around all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
afternoon, and I hate getting dressed and waiting for
a party to begin.”</p>

<p>“I’ve noticed that,” Mills replied dryly. “Just what
did you do all day? Your doings are always a mystery
to me.”</p>

<p>“Well—let me see—I went downtown with Millie
this morning, and home with her for lunch, and we
talked a while and I ran out to the Burtons’ and there
were some people there and we gassed; and then I remembered
I hadn’t seen Mrs. Torrence since she got
home, so I took a dash up there. And Connie was
there, and Bud Henderson came up with Mr. Storrs
and we had tea and Mr. Storrs was coming this way
so I let him drive me home.”</p>

<p>This, uttered with smooth volubility, was hardly
half the truth. She lighted a fresh cigarette and blew
a series of rings while waiting to see whether he would
crossexamine her, as he sometimes did.</p>

<p>“Constance was there, was she? Anyone else?”</p>

<p>“Fred Thomas and Georgy Whitford blew in just
as I was leaving.”</p>

<p>“So? I shouldn’t have thought Mrs. Torrence
would be interested in them.”</p>

<p>“Oh, she isn’t!” replied Leila, who hadn’t intended
to mention Thomas or Whitford. “Connie was trying
to talk Helen into taking a perfectly marvelous part in
a new play the Dramatic Club’s putting on soon, and
they are in it, too. Highbrow discussion; it bored me
awfully—Mr. Storrs and I managed to escape together.
Oh, dear, I’m sleepy!”</p>

<p>“Does this Storrs go about among people you know?”
Mills asked, extending his arm to the ash tray.</p>

<p>“Oh, I think so, Dada! He was in college with Bud
Henderson, you know, and is in Mr. Freeman’s office.
Dale’s crazy about him. You could hardly say he’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
pushing himself. Millie and I met him at the Faraway
Club—didn’t you meet him that same night? I asked
him to call and he hasn’t and he <i>has</i> been to see Millie.
I guess the joke’s on me!”</p>

<p>“I saw him again at the Hardens’,” Mills remarked
carelessly. “And ran into him afterwards when I was
strolling around, and I brought him back with me to
get out of the storm. It was the night of the Claytons’
party.”</p>

<p>“Then you know as much about him as I do,” said
Leila indifferently. “I think, Dada, if you don’t mind,
I’ll seek the hay.”</p>

<p>He stood to receive her good-night kiss. When he
heard her door close he took several turns across the
room before resuming his cigar. He sat down in the
chair in which he had sat the night he brought Bruce
into the house. Magazines and books were within
easy reach of his hand, but he was not in a mood to
read. He lifted his eyes occasionally to the portrait
of his father on the opposite wall. It might have
seemed that he tried to avoid it, averting his gaze to
escape the frank, steady eyes. But always the fine face
drew him back. When he got up finally and walked
to the door it was with a hurried step as if the room
or his meditations had suddenly become intolerable.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER NINE</h2>
</div>


<h3>I</h3>

<p>The morning after his dinner party Franklin Mills
rose at eight o’clock. He had slept badly, an unusual
thing with him, and he found little satisfaction in an
attempt to account for his wakefulness on the score of
something he had eaten. As he shaved he found that
he was not performing the familiar rite automatically
as usual. He tried a succession of blades and became
impatient when they failed to work with their usual
smoothness.... Perhaps he was smoking too much,
and he made a computation of the number of cigars
and cigarettes he had smoked the day before, and
decided that he had exceeded his usual allowance by a
couple of cigars.</p>

<p>The mental exercise necessary to reach this conclusion
steadied him. He had no intention of breaking, as
some of his friends and contemporaries had broken,
from sheer inattention to the laws of health. He attained
a degree of buoyancy as he dressed by thinking
of his immunity from the cares that beset most men.
No other man in town enjoyed anything like his freedom.
He had not dreaded age because he never thought
of himself as old. And yet the years were passing.</p>

<p>He must study means of deferring old age. Marriage<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
might serve to retard the march of time. The
possibility of remarrying had frequently of late teased
his imagination. Leila would leave him one of these
days; he must have a care that she married well. Mills
had plans for Carroll’s future; Carroll would be a most
acceptable son-in-law. Leila had so far shown no interest
in the secretary, but Leila had the Mills common
sense; when it came to marrying, Leila would listen to
reason.</p>

<p>He called his man to serve breakfast in his room,
read the morning paper, inspected his wardrobe and
indicated several suits to be pressed.</p>

<p>From his south window he viewed the Harden house
across the hedge. Millicent was somewhere within....
It might be a mistake to marry a girl as young as
Millicent. He knew of men who had made that mistake,
but Millicent was not to be measured by ordinary
standards. With all the charm of youth, she was amazingly
mature; not a feather-brained girl who would
marry him for his money. There was the question of
her family, her lack of social background; but possibly
he magnified the importance of such things. His
own standing, he argued, gave him certain rights; he
could suffer nothing in loss of dignity by marrying
Millicent. It gave a man the appearance of youth to
be seen with a young wife. Helen Torrence would not
do; she lacked the essential dignity, and her background
was far too sketchy—no better than the Hardens’. He
had settled that....</p>

<p>The remembrance of the young architect’s head
superimposed upon the portrait of Franklin Mills III
caused him an uneasiness which he was not able to
dispel by a snap of the fingers. Any attempt to learn
what had prompted Storrs to choose for his residence
the city so long sacred to the Mills family might easily<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
arouse suspicions. The portrait in itself was a menace.
People were such fools about noting resemblances! If
his sister, Alice Thornberry, met Storrs she might remark
upon his resemblance to their father. And yet
she was just as likely to note the removal of the picture
if he relegated it to the attic....</p>

<p>By the time he had interviewed the house servants
and driven to the office Mills had passed through various
moods ranging from his habitual serenity and poise
to apprehension and foreboding. This puzzled him.
Why should he, the most equable of men, suddenly fall
a prey to moods? He put on a pair of library glasses
that he kept in his desk, though he usually employed a
pince-nez at the office—a departure that puzzled Carroll,
who did not know that Mills, in the deep preoccupation
of the morning, had left his pocket case at
home. Mills, in normal circumstances, was not given
to forgetfulness. Aware that something was amiss,
Carroll made such reports and suggestions as were
necessary with more than his usual economy of words.</p>

<p>“Doctor Lindley telephoned that he’d be in to see
you at eleven. You have no engagements and I told
him all right.”</p>

<p>“Lindley? What does Lindley want?” Mills demanded,
without looking up from a bank statement he
was scanning.</p>

<p>“He didn’t say, sir; but as you always see him——”</p>

<p>“I don’t know that I care to see him today,” Mills
mumbled. Mills rarely mumbled; his speech was always
clean-cut and definite.</p>

<p>Carroll, listening attentively to his employer’s instructions
as to answering letters and sending telegraphic
orders for the sale of certain stocks, speculated
as to what had caused Mills’s unwonted irascibility.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>A few minutes after eleven word was passed from
the office boy to the stenographer and thence from
Carroll to Mills that the Reverend Doctor Lindley was
waiting.</p>

<p>Mills detained Carroll rather unnecessarily to discuss
matters of no immediate moment. This in itself
was surprising, as the rector of St. Barnabas, the oldest
and richest church in town, had heretofore always
been admitted without delay. The Mills family had
been identified with St. Barnabas from pioneer times
and Doctor Lindley was entertained frequently by Mills,
not only at home but at the men’s luncheons Mills
gave at his clubs for visiting notables.</p>

<p>“Ah, Mills! Hard at it!” exclaimed the minister
cheerfully. He was short, rotund and bald, with a
large face that radiated good nature. A reputation for
breadth of view and public spirit had made him, in the
dozen years of his pastorate, one of the best liked men
in town. He gave Mills a cordial handshake, asked
after Leila and assured Mills that he had never seen
him looking better.</p>

<p>Lindley was a dynamic person and his presence had
the effect of disturbing the tranquility of the room.
Mills wished now that he hadn’t admitted the rector
of St. Barnabas, with his professional good cheer and
optimism. He remembered that Lindley always wanted
something when he came to the office. If it proved to
be help for a negro mission St. Barnabas maintained
somewhere, Mills resolved to refuse to contribute. He
had no intention of encouraging further the idea that
he could be relied upon to support all of Lindley’s absurd
schemes for widening the sphere of the church.
It was a vulgar idea that a sinner should prostrate himself
before an imaginary God and beg for forgiveness.
Where sin existed the main thing was to keep it decently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
out of sight. But the whole idea of sin was
repellent. He caught himself up sharply. What had
he to do with sin?</p>

<p>But outwardly Mills was serene; Lindley was at
least a diversion, though Mills reflected that someone
ought to warn him against his tendency to obesity. A
fat man in a surplice was ridiculous, though Mills
hadn’t seen Lindley in vestments since the last fashionable
wedding. At the reception following the wedding
Mills remembered that he had been annoyed by
Lindley’s appetite; more particularly by a glimpse of
the rector’s plump hand extended for a second piece
of cake—cake with a thick, gooey icing.</p>

<p>Mills wondered what he had ever seen that was
likable in the rector, who certainly suggested nothing
of apostolic austerity. Lindley threw back his coat,
disclosing a gold cross suspended from a cord that
stretched across his broad chest. Mills’s eyes fixed
upon the emblem disapprovingly as he asked his visitor
to have a cigar.</p>

<p>“No, thanks, Mills; I never smoke so early in the
day—found it upset me. Moderation in all things is
my motto. I missed you at the Clayton party the
other night; a brilliant affair. Dear Leila was there,
though, and Shepherd and his charming wife, to represent
your family. Margaret and I left early.” The
clergyman chuckled and lowering his voice continued:
“I’ve heard—I’ve heard <i>whispers</i> that later on the party
got quite gay! I tell you, Mills, the new generation
is stepping high. All the more responsibility for the
forces that make for good in this world! I was saying
to the bishop only the other day that the church never
before faced such perplexities as now!”</p>

<p>“Why do you say perplexities?” asked Mills in the
quiet tone and indulgent manner of an expert cross-examiner<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
who is preparing pitfalls for a witness.</p>

<p>“Ah, I see you catch at the word! It’s become a
serious question what the church dare do! There’s the
danger of offending; of estranging its own membership.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but why is it a danger?” Mills persisted.</p>

<p>The minister was surprised at these questions, which
were wholly foreign to all his previous intercourse with
Mills. His eyes opened and shut quickly. The Reverend
Stuart Lindley was known as a man’s man, a
clergyman who viewed humanity in the light of the
twentieth century and was particularly discerning as
to the temptations and difficulties that beset twentieth
century business men.</p>

<p>“My dear Mills,” he said ingratiatingly, “you know
and I know that this is an age of compromise. We
clergymen are obliged to temper our warnings. The
wind, you know, no longer blows on the lost sheep with
the violence it once manifested, or at least the sheep no
longer notice it!” A glint in Mills’s eyes gave him
pause, but he went on hurriedly. “In certain particulars
we must yield a little without appearing to yield. Do
you get my point?”</p>

<p>“Frankly, I don’t know that I do,” Mills replied
bluntly. “You preach that certain things are essential
to the salvation of my soul. What right have you to
compromise with me or anyone else? You either believe
the Gospel and the creeds that are used every day
in our churches or you don’t. I didn’t mean to start
a theological discussion; I was just a little curious as
to what you meant by perplexities, when the obligation
is as plain as that table.”</p>

<p>“But—you see the difficulties! We have a right to
assume that God is perfectly aware of all that goes on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
in His world and that the changing times are only a
part of His purpose.”</p>

<p>“Well, yes,” Mills assented without enthusiasm.
“But I was thinking of what you and the church I was
born into declare to be necessary to the Christian life.
I go to church rarely, as you know, but I’m fairly
familiar with the New Testament. I’ve got a copy
with the words of Jesus printed in bold type, so you
can’t miss His meaning. He was pretty explicit; His
meaning hits you squarely in the eye!”</p>

<p>“But, my dear friend, above all He preached tolerance!
He knew human frailty! There’s the great
secret of His power.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s all true!” said Mills, with courteous forbearance.
“But you know very well that few of us—no—I’ll
admit that <i>I</i> don’t live the Christian life except
where it’s perfectly easy and convenient. Why talk
of the perplexities of the ministry when there’s no
excuse for any of us to mistake His teachings? You
either preach Jesus or you don’t! We lean heavily on
His tolerance because we can excuse ourselves with
that; it’s only an alibi. But what of His courage?
Whatever I may think of Him—divine or merely a
foolish idealist—He did die for His convictions! It
occurs to me sometimes that He’s served nowadays
by a pretty cowardly lot of followers. Oh—not you,
my friend!—I don’t mean anyone in particular—except
myself! Probably there are other men who think
much as I do, but we don’t count. We pay to keep
the churches going, but we don’t want to be bothered
about our duty to God. <i>That’s</i> a disagreeable subject!”</p>

<p>He ended with a smile that was intended to put
Lindley at ease.</p>

<p>“You are absolutely right, Mills!” declared the minister<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
magnanimously. “But as a practical man you
realize that there <i>are</i> embarrassments in the way of
doing our full duty.”</p>

<p>“No; truly, I don’t!” Mills retorted. “We either do
it or we don’t. But please don’t think I meant to quiz
you or be annoying. I wouldn’t offend you for anything
in the world!”</p>

<p>“My dear <i>Mills</i>!” cried the clergyman with the disdain
demanded by so monstrous a suggestion.</p>

<p>“It never occurred to me before,” Mills went on, his
good humor only faintly tinged with irony, “it never
struck me in just this way before, but I suppose if
you were to preach to your congregation just what
Jesus preached you’d empty the church.”</p>

<p>“Well, of course——” began Lindley, with difficulty
concealing his surprise at the dogged fashion in which
Mills was pursuing the subject.</p>

<p>“Of course you can’t do it!” With a bland smile
Mills finished the sentence for him. “Jesus is the
Great Example of a perfect life; but do we any of
us really want to live as He lived?”</p>

<p>“Ah, Mills, we can only approximate perfection;
that’s the best we can hope for!”</p>

<p>“Thank you! There’s some consolation in that!”
Mills laughed. “But if we really took the teachings
of Jesus literally we wouldn’t be sitting here; we’d be
out looking up people who need shelter, food, cheer.
As it is I’m not bothering my head about them. I
pay others to do that—Carroll hands me a list of organizations
he considers worthy of assistance and all
I do is to sign the checks—ought to be ashamed of
myself, oughtn’t I?”</p>

<p>“Well, now, Mills,” Lindley laughed pleasantly,
“that’s a matter I leave to your own conscience.”</p>

<p>“But you oughtn’t to! It’s your duty to tell me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
that instead of riding up to a comfortable club today
to eat luncheon with a couple of bankers I ought first
to be sure that every man, woman and child in the
community is clothed and fed and happy.”</p>

<p>“What would you do if I did?” Lindley demanded,
bending forward and regarding Mills fixedly.</p>

<p>“I’d tell you to go to the Devil!”</p>

<p>“There you are!” cried Lindley with a gesture of
resignation. “You know your duty to your neighbor
as well as I do. The affair isn’t between you and me,
after all, my dear friend—it’s between you and God!”</p>

<p>“God?” Mills repeated the word soberly, his eyes
turning to the window and the picture it framed, of a
sky blurred by the smoke of factory chimneys. “I
wonder——” he added, half to himself.</p>

<p>Lindley was puzzled and embarrassed, uncertain
whether to try to explain himself further. His intuitions
were keen and in his attempt to adjust himself
to a new phase of Mills’s character he groped for an
explanation of the man’s surprising utterances. There
had been something a little wistful in Mills’s use of
the word <i>God</i>. Lindley was sincerely eager to help
where help was needed, but as he debated whether Mills
really had disclosed any need that he could satisfy,
Mills ended the matter by saying a little wearily:</p>

<p>“What was it you wanted to see me about, Lindley?”</p>

<p>“It’s about the Mills memorial window in St. Barnabas;
the transept wall’s settled lately and pulled the
window out of plumb. Some of the panels are loose.
The excavations for the new building across the alley
caused the disturbance. Now that the building’s up
we’ll hope the worst is over. That’s one of the finest
windows in the West. The figure of our Lord feeding
the multitude is beautifully conceived. I had Freeman<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
look at it and he says we’ll have to get an expert out
from New York to take care of it properly. The
vestry’s hard up as usual, but I felt sure you’d want us
to have the job well done——”</p>

<p>“Certainly, Lindley. Go ahead and send me the
bill. Of course I’m glad to take care of it.”</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>Mills was himself again. The mention of the Mills
memorial window had touched his pride. The window
not only symbolized the miraculous powers of Jesus,
but quite concretely it visualized for the congregation
of St. Barnabas the solid worth and continuity of the
house of Mills.</p>

<p>He detained Lindley, gave him a chance to tell a
story, made sure before he permitted him to go that
the minister had not been wounded by anything he had
said. He had come out pretty well in his talk with
the minister; it did no harm to ruffle the complacency
of a man like Lindley occasionally. But he wanted
to guard against a return of the vexatious thoughts
with which the day had begun.</p>

<p>A ride would set him up and he would find some
cheerful companions to join him at the farm. Usually
he planned his parties ahead, but the day was too fine
to let pass. He rang for Carroll, his spirits already
mounting at the thought of escaping from town.</p>

<p>“I believe I’ll run out to Deer Trail this afternoon.
I’ll ask some people who like to ride to join me. Will
you call Mrs. Freeman, Mrs. Torrence, Leila and Miss
Harden? I’ll be glad to have you go if you can arrange
it—I’ll leave it all to you. As to men, try Doctor
Armstrong, Mr. Turner, Ralph Burton—say that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
I’ll send machines to take them out unless they prefer
using their own cars. You’ll look after that?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes; if Shep calls up tell him I’ll see him later
about those battery plant matters. I want to talk to
Fields first....”</p>

<p>“Yes; I understand, sir.”</p>

<p>“Let me see; this was the day Freeman was to meet
me out there to look over the superintendent’s house.
I’ve promised Jackson to make the addition he wants
this fall. Freeman’s probably forgotten it—he has a
genius for forgetting engagements, and I’d overlooked
your memorandum till just now. Freeman hates a
horse, but if he goes it will only take a few minutes to
show him what’s wanted.”</p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>Bruce was finding his association with Freeman increasingly
agreeable. The architect, amusingly indifferent
and careless as to small things, was delighted to
find that his new subordinate was not afraid to assume
responsibility and grateful that Bruce was shielding
him from the constant pecking of persons who called
or telephoned about trivial matters.</p>

<p>“By the way, Storrs, can you run into the country
this afternoon?” Freeman asked. “I promised Franklin
Mills I’d meet him at his farm to look at the superintendent’s
house. I’ve put him off several times and
now that Brookville man’s coming in to talk house and
I’ve got to see him. There’s not much to do but get
data and make my apologies to Mills. Mrs. Freeman
just called up to say she’s going out there to ride.
Mills is having a party, so he’ll get through with you
quickly. I don’t want him to think me indifferent
about his work. He’s been a loyal client.”</p>

<p>“Yes, certainly,” Bruce replied, reluctant to trouble
Freeman by refusing, but not relishing another meeting
with Mills.</p>

<p>“Everybody knows where Deer Trail is—you’ll have
no trouble finding it. I think he said he’d be there by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
two-thirty. Listen carefully to what he says, and I’ll
take the matter up with him tomorrow. Now about
the specifications for that Sterling house——”</p>

<p>It was thus that Bruce found himself at Deer Trail
Farm on the afternoon of the day that Mills was giving
his riding party. Mills, with whom punctuality was a
prime virtue, came down the steps in his riding clothes
and good-naturedly accepted Bruce’s excuses in Freeman’s
behalf.</p>

<p>“Freeman’s a busy man, of course, and a job like
this is a good deal of a nuisance. You can get the
idea just as well. Can you ride a horse?”</p>

<p>Bruce, whose eyes had noted with appreciation the
horses that had been assembled in the driveway, said
that he could.</p>

<p>“All right, then; we’ll ride over. It’s nearly a mile
and we’ll save time.”</p>

<p>He let Bruce choose a horse for himself from a dozen
or more thoroughbreds, watched him mount with critical
but approving eyes, and they set off over a road
that led back through the fields. Mills sat a horse
well; he had always ridden, he explained as they traversed
the well-made gravel road at a trot. Finding
that Bruce knew something of the American saddle
stocks, he compared various breeds, calling attention
to the good points of the horses they were riding.</p>

<p>When they reached the superintendent’s house Bruce
found that what was required was an extension that
would provide the family with additional sleeping
rooms. He took measurements, made notes, suggested
a few difficulties, and in reply to Mills’s questions expressed
his belief that the addition could be made without
spoiling the appearance of the house.</p>

<p>“I suppose I really ought to tear it down and build
a new house, but this hundred acres right here has been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
in my family a long time and the place has associations.
I hate to destroy it.”</p>

<p>“I can understand that,” said Bruce, busy with his
notebook. “I think I have all the data Mr. Freeman
will need, sir.”</p>

<p>As they rode back Mills talked affably of the country;
spoke of the history and traditions of the neighborhood,
and the sturdy character of the pioneers who
had settled the region.</p>

<p>“I used to think sometimes of moving East—settling
somewhere around New York. But I’ve never been
able to bring myself to it. This is my own country
right here. Over there—you notice that timber?—well,
I’ll never cut that. This whole region was forest
in the early days. I’ve kept that strip of woodland
as a reminder of the men who broke through the wilderness
with nothing but their rifles and axes.”</p>

<p>“They were a great race,” Bruce remarked....</p>

<p>Mills called attention to a young orchard he had
lately planted, and to his conservatories, where he
amused himself, he said, trying to produce a new rose.</p>

<p>“Won’t you stay and join in the ride?” he asked as
they dismounted. “I can fit you out with breeches
and puttees. I’d be delighted to have you.”</p>

<p>“Thanks, but I must get into town,” Bruce replied.</p>

<p>“Well, if you must! Please don’t let Freeman go
to sleep on this job!”</p>

<p>Bruce, glad that his duty had been performed so
easily, was starting toward his car when a familiar
voice hailed him from the broad pillared veranda.</p>

<p>“Why the hurry? Aren’t you in this party?”</p>

<p>He swung round to find Millicent Harden, dressed
for the saddle, standing at the edge of the veranda a
little apart from the animated group of Mills’s other
guests. As he walked toward her she came down the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
steps to meet him. The towering white pillars made
a fitting frame for her. Here, as in the library of her
own house, the ample background served to emphasize
her pictorial effectiveness. Her eyes shone with happy
expectancy.</p>

<p>“I don’t care if you are here on business, you
shouldn’t be running away! On a day like this nobody
should be in town.”</p>

<p>“Somebody has to work in this world. How are
the organ and the noble knight?”</p>

<p>“Both would be glad to welcome you. Leila’s growing
superstitious about you; she says you’re always
saving her life. Oh, she confessed everything about
last night!—how you ministered to her and set her on
her father’s doorstep in fine shape. And she’s going
to be a good girl now. We must see that she is!”</p>

<p>At this moment Leila detached herself from the
company on the veranda and called his attention to the
fact that Mrs. Freeman was trying to bow to him.
Mills, who had been discussing the fitness of one of
the horses with his superintendent, announced that he
was ready to start.</p>

<p>“I wish you were coming along,” said Leila; “there’s
scads of horses. We’d all adore having you!”</p>

<p>“I’d adore coming!” Bruce answered. “But I’ve
really got to skip.”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell Dada to ask you another time. Dada isn’t
at all bad when you know him, is he, Millie?”</p>

<p>“Oh, one learns to tolerate him!” said Millicent
teasingly.</p>

<p>“You might like driving through the farm—good
road all the way from that tall elm down there,” suggested
Leila, “and it takes you through our woods.
The maples are putting on their pink bonnets. There’s
a winding stretch over yonder that’s a little wild, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
it’s interesting, and you can’t get lost. It would be a
shame to dash back to town without seeing something
of this gorgeous day!”</p>

<p>“All right, thanks; I’ll try it,” said Bruce.</p>

<p>With his roadster in motion he wondered dejectedly
whether there was any way of remaining in the town
and yet avoiding Franklin Mills and his family. But
the sight of Millicent had heartened him. The glowing
woodlands were brighter for his words with her. He
wished he might have taken her away from Mills and
his party and ridden alone with her in the golden haze
of the loveliest of autumn afternoons....</p>

<p>Suddenly when he was beyond the Deer Trail boundaries
and running along slowly he came upon a car
drawn up close to the stake-and-rider fence that enclosed
a strip of woodland. His quiet approach over
the soft winding road had not been noted by the two
occupants of the car, a man and a woman.</p>

<p>Two lovers, presumably, who had sought a lonely
spot where they were unlikely to be observed, and
Bruce was about to speed his car past them when the
woman lifted her head with an involuntary cry of surprise
that caused him, quite as involuntarily, to turn his
gaze upon her. It was Constance Mills; her companion
was George Whitford.</p>

<p>“Hello, there!” Whitford cried, and Bruce stopped
his car and got out. “Mrs. Mills and I are out looking
at the scenery. We started for the Faraway Club, but
lost interest.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t this a heavenly day?” remarked Mrs. Mills
with entire serenity. “George and I have been talking
poetry—an ideal time for it!” She held up a book.
“Yeats—he’s so marvelous! Where on earth are you
wandering to?”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>“I’ve been to Deer Trail—a little errand with Mr.
Mills for my boss.”</p>

<p>“Oh, is Mr. Mills at the farm? What is it—a
party?” she asked carelessly.</p>

<p>“Yes, Miss Mills, Miss Harden, Mrs. Torrence and
Mrs. Freeman are there to ride—I didn’t make them
all out.”</p>

<p>“It sounds quite gay,” she said languidly. “I’ve
thought a lot about our talk yesterday. You evidently
delivered Leila home without trouble. It was awfully
sweet of you, I’m sure. I don’t believe we’ll go in to
the farm, George. I think a crowd of people would
bore me today, and we must get back to town.”</p>

<p>Whitford started his car, and as they moved away
Constance leaned out and smiled and waved her hand.
Bruce stood for a moment gazing after them, deep in
thought. Constance Mills, he decided, was really a
very clever woman.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>After his visit to Deer Trail Farm Bruce found himself
in a cynical humor with reference to his own life
and the lives of the people with whom he had lately
come in contact. Nothing was substantial or definite.
He read prodigiously—poetry and philosophy, and the
latest discussions of the problems of the time; caught
in these an occasional gleam. It seemed centuries ago
that he had walked in the Valley of the Shadow in
France. The tragedy of war seemed as nothing
weighed against the tragedy of his own life.</p>

<p>Why had she told him? was a question he despairingly
asked himself. His mother had had no right to
go out of the world leaving him to carry the burden
her confession had laid upon him. Then again, with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
a quickening of his old affection for her, he felt that
some motive, too fine and high for his understanding,
had impelled her to the revelation....</p>

<p>He had settled himself to read one evening when
Henderson, always unexpected in his manifestations
of sociability, dropped in at his apartment.</p>

<p>“Maybelle’s at Shep Mills’s rehearsing in a new
Dramatic Club show, so I romped up here hoping to
catch you in. I guessed you’d be here laughing heartily
all to yourself. I’ve cut the booze; honest I have.
My bootlegger strolled in today, but I kissed him good-bye
forever. So don’t offer me any licker; my noble
resolution isn’t so strong that I mightn’t yield to a
whisper from the devil.”</p>

<p>“You’re safe! There’s nothing stronger on the
premises than a tooth wash warranted not to remove
the enamel.”</p>

<p>Henderson picked up the book Bruce had been reading,
“A World in Need of God,” and ran his eye over
the chapter headings.</p>

<p>“‘The Unlit Lamp,’ ‘The Descent Perilous,’ ‘Untended
Altars’—so you’ve got it too, have you?”</p>

<p>“I’ve got the book, if that’s what you mean,” Bruce
replied. “I paid two dollars for it. It’s a gloomy
work; no wonder the author put it out anonymously.”</p>

<p>“It’s a best seller,” Henderson replied mournfully
as he seated himself and drew out his pipe. “The
world is nervous about itself—doesn’t know whether
to repent and be good or stroll right along to the fiery
pit. Under my stoical exterior, Bruce, old boy, I
trouble a good deal about the silly human race. That
phrase, ‘The Descent Perilous,’ gives me a chill. If
I’d edited that book I’d have made it ‘The Road to
Hell is Easy’ and drawn a stirring picture of the universe
returning to chaos to the music of jazzy bands.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
People seem anxious to be caught all lit up when our
little planet jumps the track and runs amuck. But
there really are a few imbeciles, like the chap who produced
that book, who’re troubled about the whole business.
We all think we’re playing comedy rôles, but if
we’d just take a good square look at ourselves in the
mirror we’d see that we’re made up for tragedy.”</p>

<p>“Lordy! Hear the boy talk! If I’d known you
were coming I’d have hidden the book.”</p>

<p>“There’s a joke! I’ve been in several prosperous
homes lately where I got a glimpse of that joyous work
stuck under the sofa pillows. Everybody’s afraid to
be caught with it—afraid it points to a state of panic
in the purchaser. It’s the kind of thing folks read and
know it’s all true, and get so low in their minds they
pull the old black bottle from its hiding place and seek
alcoholic oblivion.”</p>

<p>“I bought the thing as a matter of business. If all
creation’s going to shoot the chutes I want to be prepared.
It’s silly for me to get all set to build houses
for people if the world’s coming to an end.”</p>

<p>“By Jove, when the crash comes I’m going to be
stuck with a lot of Plantagenets!”</p>

<p>“But this chap thinks the world can be saved! He
says in the mad rush to find some joy in life we’re forgetting
God. The spiritual spark growing dim—all
that sort of thing.”</p>

<p>“Um-m.” Henderson took the pipe from his mouth
and peered into the bowl. “Now on this spiritual dope,
I’m a sinner—chock full of sin, original and acquired.
I haven’t been to church since my wedding except to a
couple of funerals—relations where I couldn’t dodge
the last sad rites. Cheerless, this death stuff; sort o’
brings you up with a jerk when you think of it. Most
of us these days are frantically trying to forget man’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
inevitable destiny by running as wild as we dare—blindfolded.
It isn’t fashionable to be serious about
anything. I tell you, my boy, I could count on the
fingers of one hand all the people I know who ever
take a good square look at life.”</p>

<p>“Oh, not as bad as that!” said Bruce, surprised at
Henderson’s unwonted earnestness. “There must be a
lot of people who are troubled about the state of their
souls—who have some sort of ideals but are ashamed to
haul them out!”</p>

<p>“Ashamed is the word!” Henderson affirmed. “We’re
afraid of being kidded if anybody sneaks up on us and
catches us admiring the Ten Commandments or practicing
the Christian virtues! Now I know the rattle of
all the skeletons in all the closets in this town. If they
all took a notion to trot up and down our main thoroughfares
some moonlit evening they’d make quite a
parade. You understand I’m not sitting in judgment
on my fellow man; I merely view him at times like this,
when I’m addressing a man of intellect like you, with
a certain cheerful detachment. And I see things going
on—and I take part in them—that I deplore. I swear I
deplore them; particularly,” he went on with a grim
smile, “on days when I’m suffering from a severe case
of hang-overitis.”</p>

<p>“You must have been on a roaring tear last night.
You have all the depressing symptoms.”</p>

<p>“A cruel injustice! I’m never terribly wicked. I
drink more than I need at times and I flirt occasionally
to keep my hand in. Maybelle doesn’t mind if I wander
a little, but when she whistles I’m right back at
my own fireside pretending nothing happened.”</p>

<p>“I’ll wager you do!” laughed Bruce.</p>

<p>“Right now,” Henderson went on, “I can see a few
people we both know who are bound to come a cropper<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
if they don’t mind their steps. There’s Connie
Mills. Not a bad sort, Connie, but a little bit too afraid
she isn’t having as much fun as she’s entitled to. And
Shep—the most high-minded, unselfish fellow I know—he,
poor nut, just perishing for somebody to love him!”</p>

<p>“What sort of a chap’s George Whitford?” Bruce
asked.</p>

<p>“First class,” Bud answered promptly. “A real fellow;
about the best we’ve got. Something of the soldier
of fortune about him. A variety of talents; brilliant
streak in him. Why do you ask? George getting
on your preserves?”</p>

<p>“Lord, no! I was just wondering whether you’d
knock him. I like him myself.”</p>

<p>“Well, nearly everyone does. He appeals to the
imagination. Just a little too keen about women, however,
for his own good.”</p>

<p>A buzzer sounded and Bruce went to the telephone
by which visitors announced themselves from the hall
below.</p>

<p>“Mr. Carroll? Certainly; come right up!”</p>

<p>“Carroll? Didn’t know you were so chummy with
him,” Henderson grumbled, not pleased by the interruption.</p>

<p>“I run into him at the club occasionally. He’s been
threatening to drop in some evening. Seems to be a
nice chap.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, Carroll’s all right!” Bud grinned. “We
might proceed with our discussion of the Millses.
Arthur ought to know a few merry facts not disclosed
to the general public. He wears the mask of meekness,
but that’s purely secretarial, so to speak.”</p>

<p>Carroll, having reached the apartment, at once began
bantering Henderson about the Plantagenet Bud had
lately sold him.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>“I’m another Plantag victim,” said Bruce. “Bud’s
conscience is hurting him; he’s moaning over the general
depravity of the world.”</p>

<p>“He should worry!” said Carroll. “The Plantagenet’s
shaken my faith in Heaven.”</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>Carroll, Bruce knew, was a popular man in town,
no doubt deriving special consideration from his association
with Mills. His name was written into local
history almost as far back as that of the Mills family.
In giving up the law to become Mills’s right-hand man
it was assumed that he had done so merely for the
benefit to be derived from contact with a man of Mills’s
importance. He dabbled somewhat in politics, possibly,
it was said, that he might be in a position to serve
Mills when necessary in frustrating any evil designs of
the State or the municipal government upon Mills’s
interests.</p>

<p>Bruce had wondered a little when Carroll intimated
his purpose to look him up; he had even speculated as
to whether Mills might not have prompted this demonstration
of friendliness for some purpose of his own.
But Carroll bore all the marks of a gentleman; he was
socially in demand and it was grossly ungenerous to
think that his call had any motive beyond a wish to be
courteous to a new member of the community.</p>

<p>Carroll was tall and slender, with light brown hair
and deep-set blue eyes. His clean-shaven face was
rather deeply lined for a man of his years; there was
something of the air of a student about him. But
when he spoke it was in the crisp, incisive tones of
an executive. A second glance at his eyes discovered
hints of reserve strength. Serving an exacting man<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
had not destroyed his independence and self-respect.
On the whole a person who knew what he was about,
endowed with brains and not easily to be trampled upon
or driven.</p>

<p>“You mustn’t let Bud fool you about our home town.
Most anything he says is bound to be wrong; it’s temperamental
with him. But you know him of old; I
needn’t tell you what a scoundrel he is.”</p>

<p>“Certainly not! You can’t room with a man for
four years without knowing all his weaknesses.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I certainly know all yours,” Henderson retorted.
“But he isn’t a bad fellow, Arthur. We must
marry him off and settle him in life. I already see
several good chances to plant him.”</p>

<p>“You’d better let Maybelle do that,” replied Carroll.
“Your judgment in such delicate matters can’t
be trusted.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps I’d better leave the room while you make a
choice for me,” said Bruce.</p>

<p>“What would you think of Leila Mills as a fitting
mate for him?” asked Henderson.</p>

<p>“Excellent,” Carroll affirmed. “It’s about time Leila
was married. You’ve met Miss Mills, haven’t you,
Storrs?”</p>

<p>“Yes; several times,” said Bruce. He suspected Bud
of turning the conversation upon Leila merely to gratify
his passion for gossip.</p>

<p>“Of course you’ve got the first call, Arthur,” said
Henderson with cheerful impudence. “The town is
getting impatient waiting for you to show your
hand.”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry to keep my fellow citizens waiting,” Carroll
replied. “Of course there are always Miss Mills’s
wishes to consider.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, there <i>is</i> that! Bruce, with his known<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
affection for the arts, may prefer the lovely Millicent.
He’s not worth troubling about as a competitor. Well,
I must skip back to Maybelle! Wait till I get downstairs
before you begin knocking me!”</p>

<p>“Don’t be in a rush,” said Bruce.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ll go now!” said Bud as he lounged out. “I
want you to have plenty of time to skin me properly!”</p>

<p>“Bud’s a mighty good fellow,” said Carroll when
they were alone. “He and Maybelle give a real tang
to our social affairs. I suppose we have Bud to thank
for bringing you here.”</p>

<p>“Oh, not altogether!” Bruce replied. “I was alone in
the world and my home town hadn’t much to offer an
architect.”</p>

<p>“Your profession does need room. I was born right
here and expect to be buried among my ancestors. Let
me see—did I hear that you’re from the East?”</p>

<p>The question on its face was courteously perfunctory;
Mills would certainly not have done anything so
clumsy, Bruce reflected, as to send Carroll to probe
into his history.</p>

<p>“I’m an Ohioan—born in Laconia,” he replied.</p>

<p>“Not really! I have an uncle and some cousins there.
Just today we had a letter at the office from Laconia,
an inquiry about a snarl in the title to some property.
Mr. Mills’s father—of the same name—once had some
interests there—a stave factory, I think it was. Long
before your day, of course. He bought some land
near the plant—the Millses have always gone in strong
for real estate—thinking he might need it if the business
developed. Mr. Mills was there for a while as a
young man. Suppose he didn’t like the business, and
his father sold out. I was there a year ago visiting
my relations and I met some Bruces—Miss Carolyn
Bruce—awfully jolly girl—related to you?”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>“My cousin. Bruce was my mother’s name.”</p>

<p>“The old saying about the smallness of the world!
Splendid girl—not married yet?”</p>

<p>“Not when I heard from her last week.”</p>

<p>“We might drive over there sometime next spring
and see her.”</p>

<p>“Fine. Carolyn was always a great pal of mine.
Laconia’s a sociable town. Everybody knows everybody
else; it’s like a big family. We can’t laugh so
gaily at the small towns; they’ve got a lot that’s mighty
fine. I sometimes think our social and political regeneration
has got to begin with the small units.”</p>

<p>“I say that sometimes to Mr. Mills,” Carroll continued.
“But he’s of the old ultra-conservative school;
a pessimist as to the future, or pretends to be. He
really sees most things pretty straight. But men of
his sort hate the idea of change. They prefer things
as they are.”</p>

<p>“I think we all want the changes to come slowly—gradual
evolution socially and politically,” Bruce ventured.
“That’s the only safe way. The great business
of the world is to find happiness—get rid of misery
and violence and hatred. I’m for everything that
moves toward that end.”</p>

<p>“I’m with you there,” Carroll replied quickly.</p>

<p>Bruce’s liking for Carroll increased. Mills’s secretary
was not only an agreeable companion but he expressed
views on many questions that showed knowledge
and sound reasoning. He referred to Mills now
and then, always with respect but never with any trace
of subserviency. Bruce, now that his fear had passed,
was deriving a degree of courage merely from talking
with Carroll. Carroll, in daily contact with Mills, evidently
was not afraid of him. And what had he,
Bruce Storrs, to fear from Franklin Mills? There<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
could not have been any scandal about Mills’s affair
with his mother or she herself would probably have
mentioned it; or more likely she would never have told
him her story. Carroll’s visit was reassuring every
way that Bruce considered it.</p>

<p>“I got a glimpse of you at Deer Trail the other day,”
Carroll was saying. “You were there about the superintendent’s
house—Mr. Mills spoke of you afterward—said
you seemed to know your business. He’s not so
hard to please as many people think—only”—Carroll
smiled—“it’s always safer to do things his way.”</p>

<p>“I imagine it is!” Bruce assented.</p>

<p>Carroll remained until the clock on the mantel
chimed twelve.</p>

<p>“I hope you’ve enjoyed this as much as I have!” he
said. “If there’s anything I can do for you, give me
a ring. Mr. Mills is a regular client of Freeman’s.
We’ll doubtless meet in a business way from time to
time.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER ELEVEN</h2>
</div>


<h3>I</h3>

<p>On a Sunday afternoon a fortnight later Bruce,
having been reproved by Dale Freeman for his recent
neglect of her, drove to the architect’s house. He had
hoped to see Millicent there and was disappointed not
to find her.</p>

<p>“You expected to see someone in particular!” said
Dale. “I can tell by the roving look in your eye.”</p>

<p>“I was merely resenting the presence of these other
people. My eyes are for you alone!”</p>

<p>“What a satisfactory boy you are! But it was Millicent,
wasn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Lady, lady! You’re positively psychic! Do you
also tell fortunes?”</p>

<p>“It’s easy to tell yours! I see a beautiful blonde in
your life! Sorry I can’t produce Millie today. She’s
not crazy about my Sunday parties; she hates a crowd.
I must arrange something small for you two. You
must meet that girl who just came in alone—the one
in the enchanting black gown. She’s a Miss Abrams,
a Jewess, very cultivated—lovely voice.”</p>

<p>The rooms were soon crowded. Bruce was still talking
to Miss Abrams when he caught sight of Shepherd
and Constance Mills, who had drifted in with Fred<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
Thomas. A young man with a flowing tie and melancholy
dark eyes claimed Miss Abrams’s attention
and Bruce turned to find Shepherd at his elbow.</p>

<p>“Just the man I wanted to see!” Shepherd exclaimed.
“Let’s find a place where we can talk.”</p>

<p>“Not so easy to find!” said Bruce. However, he led
the way to Freeman’s den, which had not been invaded,
wondering what Franklin Mills’s son could have to
say to him.</p>

<p>“Do pardon me for cornering you this way,” Shepherd
began. “I looked for you several days at the
club, but you didn’t show up.”</p>

<p>“I’ve been too busy to go up there for luncheon,”
Bruce replied. “You could always get track of me at
the office.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but this was—is—rather confidential for the
present.” Shepherd, clasping and unclasping his hands
in an attempt to gain composure, now bent forward in
his chair and addressed Bruce with a businesslike air.
“What I want to talk to you about is that clubhouse
for our workmen. You know I mentioned it some
time ago?”</p>

<p>“Yes; I remember,” Bruce replied, surprised that
Shepherd still had the matter on his mind.</p>

<p>“It’s troubled me a good deal,” said Shepherd, with
the earnestness that always increased his stammering.
“I’ve felt that there’s a duty—a real duty and an opportunity
there. You know how it is when you get a
thing in your head you can’t get rid of—can’t argue
yourself out of?”</p>

<p>“Those perplexities are annoying. I’d assumed that
you’d given the thing up.”</p>

<p>“Well, I thought I had! But I’m determined now
to go on. There’s a piece of land I can get that’s just
the thing. That neighborhood is so isolated—the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
people have no amusements unless they come to town.
I’d like to go ahead so they can have some use of the
house this winter.”</p>

<p>Bruce nodded his sympathy with the idea.</p>

<p>“Now since I talked with you I’ve found some pictures
of such houses. I’ve got ’em here.” He drew
from his pocket some pages torn from magazines. “I
think we might spend a little more money than I thought
at first would be available. We might go thirty thousand
to get about what’s in this house I’ve marked
with a pencil.”</p>

<p>Bruce scrutinized the pictures and glanced over the
explanatory text.</p>

<p>“The idea seems to be well worked out. There are
many such clubhouses scattered over the country.
You’d want the reading room and the play room for
children and all those features?”</p>

<p>“Yes; and I like the idea of a comfortable sitting-room
where the women can gather and do their sewing
and that sort of thing. And I’d like you to do this
for me—begin getting up the plans right away.”</p>

<p>Shepherd’s tone was eager; his eyes were bright with
excitement.</p>

<p>“But, Mr. Mills, I can hardly do that! I’m really
only a subordinate in Mr. Freeman’s office. It would
be hardly square for me to take the commission—at
least not without his consent.”</p>

<p>Shepherd, who had not thought of this, frowned in
his perplexity. Since his talk with Constance he had
been anxious to get the work started before his father
heard of it; and he had been hoping to run into Bruce
somewhere to avoid visiting Freeman’s office. He felt
that if he had an architect who sympathized with the
idea everything would be simplified. His father and
Freeman met frequently, and Freeman, blunt and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
direct, was not a man who would connive at the construction
of a building, in which presumably Franklin
Mills was interested, without Mills’s knowledge.</p>

<p>His sensitive face so clearly indicated his disappointment
that Bruce, not knowing what lay behind
this unexpected revival of the clubhouse plan, said,
with every wish to be kind:</p>

<p>“Very likely Mr. Freeman would be glad to let me
do the work—but I’d rather you asked him. I’d hate
to have him think I was going behind his back to take
a job. You can understand how I’d feel about it.”</p>

<p>“I hadn’t thought of that at all!” said Shepherd sincerely.
“And of course I respect your feeling.” Then
with a little toss of the head and a gesture that expressed
his desire to be entirely frank, he added: “You
understand I’m doing this on my own hook. I think
I told you my father thought it unwise for the battery
company to do it. But I’m going ahead on my own
responsibility—with my own money.”</p>

<p>“I see,” said Bruce. “It’s fine of you to want to
do it.”</p>

<p>“I’ve <i>got</i> to do it!” said Shepherd, slapping his hand
on his knee. “And of course my father and the company
being out of it, it’s no one’s concern but my own!”</p>

<p>The door was open. Connie Mills’s laugh for a
moment rose above the blur of talk in the adjoining
rooms. Shepherd’s head lifted and his lips tightened
as though he gained confidence from his wife’s propinquity.
Mrs. Freeman appeared at the door, demanding
to know if they wanted tea, and noting their
absorption withdrew without waiting for an answer.</p>

<p>It was clear enough that Shepherd meant to put the
scheme through without his father’s consent, even in
defiance of his wishes. The idea had become an obsession
with the young man; but his sincere wish to promote<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
the comfort and happiness of his employees spoke
for so kind and generous a nature that Bruce shrank
from wounding him. Seeing Bruce hesitate, Shepherd
began to explain the sale of his trust stock to obtain
the money, which only increased Bruce’s determination
to have nothing to do with the matter.</p>

<p>“Why don’t you take it up with Mr. Carroll?” Bruce
suggested. “He might win your father over to your
side.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I couldn’t do that! Carroll, you know, is
bound to take father’s view of things. Father will be
all right about it when it’s all done. Of course after
the work starts he’ll know, so it won’t be a secret long.
I’m going ahead as a little joke on him. I think
he’ll be tickled to know I’ve got so much initiative!”</p>

<p>He laughed in his quick, eager way, hoping that he
had made this convincing. Bruce, from his observation
of Franklin Mills, was not so sanguine as to the
outcome. Mills would undoubtedly be very angry. On
the face of it he would have a right to be. And one
instinctively felt like shielding Shepherd Mills from his
own folly.</p>

<p>“If you really want my advice,” said Bruce after a
moment’s deliberation, “I’d take a little more time to
this. Before you could get your plans we’ll be having
rough weather. I’d wait till spring, when you can develop
your grounds and complete the whole thing at
once. And it would be just as well to look around a
bit—visit other cities and get the newest ideas.”</p>

<p>“You think that? I supposed there’d be time to
get the foundations in if I started right away.”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t risk it; in fact I think it would be a
serious mistake.”</p>

<p>“Well, you are probably right,” assented Shepherd,
though reluctantly, and there was a plaintive note in his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
voice. “Thanks ever so much. I guess I’ll take your
advice. I’ll let it go till spring.”</p>

<p>“Damon and Pythias couldn’t look more brotherly!”
Constance Mills stood at the doorway viewing them
with her languid smile. “It peeves me a good deal,
Mr. Storrs, that you prefer my husband’s society to
mine.”</p>

<p>“This is business, Connie,” Shepherd said. “We’ve
just finished.”</p>

<p>“Let’s say the party is just beginning,” said Bruce.
“I was just coming out to look you up.”</p>

<p>“I can’t believe it! But Leila just telephoned for
us to come out to Deer Trail and bring any of Dale’s
crowd who look amusing. That includes you, of
course, Mr. Storrs. Everyone’s gone but Helen Torrence
and Fred Thomas and Arthur Carroll. Mr. Mills
is at the farm; it’s a fad of his to have Sunday supper
in the country. Leila hates it and sent out an S. O. S.,
so we can’t desert her. No, Mr. Storrs, you can’t
duck! Millicent is there—that may add to the attractions!”</p>

<p>This with a meaningful glance at Bruce prompted
him to say that Miss Harden’s presence hardly diminished
the attractions of the farm. There was real
comedy in his inability to extricate himself from the
net in which he constantly found himself enmeshed
with the members of the house of Mills.</p>

<p>In discussing who had a car and who hadn’t, Freeman
said his machine was working badly, to which
Shepherd replied that there was plenty of room in his
limousine for the Freemans and any others who were
carless.</p>

<p>“Mr. Storrs will want to take his car,” said Constance.
“He oughtn’t really to drive out alone——”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>“Not alone, certainly not!” Bruce replied. “I shall be
honored if you will drive with me!”</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>“You didn’t mind?” asked Constance when Bruce
got his car under way.</p>

<p>“You mean do I mind driving you out? Please don’t
make me say how great the pleasure is!”</p>

<p>“You’re poking fun at me; you always do!”</p>

<p>“Never! Why, if I followed my inclinations I’d
come trotting up to your house every day. But it
wouldn’t do. You know that!”</p>

<p>“But I wouldn’t want you to do that—not unless
you——”</p>

<p>There was a bridge to cross and the pressure of
traffic at the moment called for care in negotiating it.</p>

<p>“What were you saying?” he asked as they turned
off the brilliantly lighted boulevard. The town lay
behind and they moved through open country.</p>

<p>“You know,” she said, “I gave you the sign that I
wanted to be friends. I had a feeling you knew I
needed——”</p>

<p>“What?” he demanded, curious as to the development
of her technic.</p>

<p>“Oh, just a little attention! I’ve tried in every way
to tell you that I’m horribly lonely.”</p>

<p>“But you oughtn’t to be!” he said, vaguely conscious
that they were repeating themselves.</p>

<p>“Oh, I know what you think! You think I ought
to be very content and happy. But happiness isn’t so
easy! We don’t get it just by wishing.”</p>

<p>“I suppose it’s the hardest thing in the world to
find,” he assented.</p>

<p>It was now quite dark and the stars hung brilliant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
in the cloudless heavens. In her fur coat, with a smart
toque to match, Constance had not before seemed so
beguiling. His meeting with her in the lonely road with
George Whitford and her evident wish not to be seen
that day by Franklin Mills or the members of his riding
party had rather shaken his first assumption that she
could be classified as a harmless flirt. Tonight he didn’t
care particularly. If Franklin Mills’s daughter-in-law
wanted to flirt with him he was ready to meet her
halfway.</p>

<p>“It’s strange, but you know I’m not a bit afraid of
you. And the other evening when the rest of us couldn’t
do a thing with Leila she chose you to take her home.
You have a way of inspiring confidence. Shep picks
you out, when he hardly knows you, for confidential
talks. I’ve been trying to analyze your—fascinations.”</p>

<p>“Oh, come now! Your husband thought I might
help him in a small perplexity—purely professional.
Nothing to that! And your young sister-in-law was
cross at the rest of you that day at Mrs. Torrence’s
and out of pique chose me to take her home.”</p>

<p>“But <i>I</i> trust you!”</p>

<p>“Maybe you shouldn’t!”</p>

<p>“Well, that afternoon you caught me out here with
Mr. Whitford I knew you wouldn’t tell on me. George
was a trifle nervous about it. I told him you were
the soul of discretion.”</p>

<p>“But—I didn’t see you! I didn’t see you at all!
I’m blind in both eyes and I can be deaf and dumb
when necessary!”</p>

<p>“Oh, I knew you wouldn’t rush over town telling
on me! It’s really not that! It’s because I knew you
wouldn’t that I’m wondering what—<i>what</i>—it is that
makes even your acquaintances feel that they can rely
on you. You know you’re quite a wonderful person.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
Leila and Millicent were talking about you only yesterday.
Not schoolgirl twaddle, but real appreciation!”</p>

<p>“That’s consoling! I’m glad of their good opinion.
But you—what did <i>you</i> say?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I said I thought you were disagreeable and conceited
and generally unpleasant!” She turned toward
him with her indolent laugh. “You <i>know</i> I wouldn’t
say anything unkind of you.” This in so low a tone
that it was necessary for him to bend his head to hear.
His cheek touched the furry edge of her hat thrillingly.</p>

<p>“It seems strange, our being together this way,” she
said. “I wish we hadn’t a destination. I’d like to go
right on—and on——”</p>

<p>“That would be all right as long as the gas held out!”</p>

<p>“You refuse to take me seriously!”</p>

<p>“I seem doomed to say the wrong thing to you!
You’ll have to teach me how to act and what to say.”</p>

<p>“But I’d rather be the pupil! There are many things
you could teach me!”</p>

<p>“Such as——”</p>

<p>“There’s always love!” she replied softly, lingering
upon the word; and again it was necessary to bend down
to hear. She lifted her face; he felt rather than saw
her eyes meeting his. Her breath, for a fleeting instant
on his cheek, caused him to give hurried consideration
to the ancient question whether a woman who is
willing should be kissed or whether delicate ethical
questions should outweigh the desirability of the kiss
prospective. He kissed her—first tentatively on the
cheek and then more ardently on the lips. She made
no protest; he offered no apology. Both were silent
for some time. When she spoke it was to say, with
serene irrelevance:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>“How smoothly your car runs! It increases my
respect for the Plantagenet.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s very satisfactory; some of Bud’s claims for
it are really true!”</p>

<p>Bruce was relieved; but he was equally perplexed.
It was an ungallant assumption that any man might,
in like circumstances, kiss Constance Mills. On the
other hand it eased his conscience to find that she evidently
thought so little of it. She had been quite
willing to be kissed.... She was a puzzling person,
this young woman.</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>The Freemans and the others who had started with
them had taken short cuts and were already at the
house. They passed through an entry hall into a big
square living-room. It was a fit residence for the
owner of the encompassing acres and Bruce felt the
presence of Franklin Mills before he saw him. This
was the kind of thing Mills would like. The house was
in keeping with the fertile land, the prize herds, the
high-bred horses with which he amused himself.</p>

<p>Mills welcomed the newcomers with a bluff heartiness,
as though consciously or unconsciously he adopted
a different tone in the country and wished to appear
the unobtrusive but hospitable lord of the manor. Leila
joined him as he talked a moment to Constance and
Bruce.</p>

<p>“You see you can’t dodge me! Awfully glad you
came. Millie’s here somewhere and I think old Bud
Henderson will drop in later.”</p>

<p>“There’ll be supper pretty soon,” said Mills. “We’re
just waiting for everybody to get here. I think you
know everyone. It’s a pleasure to see you here, Mr.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
Storrs. Please make yourself at home. Constance,
see that Mr. Storrs has a cocktail.”</p>

<p>The members of the company gathered about the
fire began twitting Constance and Bruce about the
length of time it had taken them to drive out. They
demanded to know what Connie had talked to him
about. He answered them in kind, appealing to Constance
to confirm his assertion that they had taken the
most expeditious route. They had discussed the political
conditions in Poland, he declared.</p>

<p>“Come with me,” said Mrs. Torrence, drawing him
away. “I want to talk to you! I’m sorry things happened
as they did on your first call. I don’t want you
to get the idea that my house is a place where I pull
nothing but rough parties! Please think better of me
than that!”</p>

<p>“Heavens, woman! Such a thought never entered
my head! I’ve been thinking seriously of coming
back! I need some more of your spiritual uplift!”</p>

<p>“Good! There’s more of that Bourbon! But I
wanted to say that I was sorry Leila came to my house
as she did. That is a problem—not a serious problem,
but the child needs a little curbing. She has one good
friend—Millicent Harden—that tall, lovely girl standing
over there. Do you know Millie?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes; I’ve even played golf with her!”</p>

<p>“My! You really have an eye! Well, you might
come to call on me! I’m a trifle old to be a good playmate
for you; but you might take me on as a sort of
aunt—not too old to be unsympathetic with youth.
When nothing better offers, look me up!”</p>

<p>“I’d been thinking seriously of falling in love with
you! Nothing is holding me back but my natural
diffidence!”</p>

<p>She raised her hand warningly.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>“Go no further! I can see that you’ve been well
trained. But it isn’t necessary to jolly me. I’m not
half the fool I look. My self-respect didn’t want you
to get the idea that I’m a wild woman. I was worried
that evening about Leila—she has a heart of gold, but
I don’t dare take any special interest in her for the
absurd reason—what do you think?—I’ve been suspected
of having designs on—our host!”</p>

<p>She laughed merrily. Her mirth was of the infectious
sort; Bruce laughed with her; one had to, even
when the provocation was slight.</p>

<p>“One doesn’t talk of one’s host,” she said with a
deep sigh, “but I was talked about enough when I married
Mr. Torrence; I’ll never try it again. But why
am I taking you into my confidence? Merely that I
want you to know my house isn’t a booze shop all the
time! I’m going to keep my eye on you. If I see
you wandering too close to the rifle pits, I’ll warn
you! May I?”</p>

<p>“Of course you may!” said Bruce, conscious of an
honest friendliness in this proffer, but not at once finding
words to express his appreciation. “Tell me, do I
look as though I might be gassed?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know whether you’re susceptible or not.
But I like you! I’m going to prove it by doing you
a favor. Come with me!”</p>

<p>The supper was a buffet affair and the butler was
distributing plates and napkins. At one side of the
room Franklin Mills was talking to Millicent. Bruce
had glanced at them occasionally, thinking with
a twinge how young Mills looked tonight, noting how
easily he seemed to be holding the girl’s interest, not
as a man much older but as a contemporary. And he
had everything to offer—his unassailable social position
and the wealth to support it. As he crossed the room<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
beside Mrs. Torrence, accommodating his long stride
to her pattering step, he saw a frown write itself fleetingly
on Mills’s brow. Millicent—in a soft blue Jersey
sport dress, with a felt hat of the same shade adorned
with a brilliant pheasant’s wing—kept her eyes upon
Mills until he had finished something he was saying.</p>

<p>“What’s it all about?” demanded Mrs. Torrence,
laying her hand upon Millicent’s arm. “We knew you
two were talking of something confidential and important;
that’s why we’re interrupting you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, we’re discussing the horrors of Sunday—and
whether it should be abolished!” said Millicent. “And
Mr. Mills won’t be serious!”</p>

<p>“Sunday’s always a hard day,” remarked Mrs. Torrence.
“I’m always worn out trying to decide whether
to go to church or stay at home.”</p>

<p>“And today?” asked Mills.</p>

<p>“I went! The sermon was most disagreeable. Doctor Lindley
told us we all know our duty to God and
can’t pretend that we don’t!”</p>

<p>“Is that what he preached?” asked Mills with a
vague smile. “What do you think of the proposition?”</p>

<p>“The man’s right! But it doesn’t make me any
happier to know it,” Mrs. Torrence replied. “Next
Sunday I’ll stay in bed.”</p>

<p>She took Mills away for the avowed purpose of
asking his private counsel in spiritual matters.</p>

<p>“Isn’t she nice?” said Millicent.</p>

<p>“I’m bound to think so; she arranged this for me!”</p>

<p>“Did she?” asked Millicent with feigned innocence.
“She did it neatly!”</p>

<p>“She promised to be my friend and then proved it,”
Bruce said, and then added, “I’m not so sure our host
quite liked being taken away.”</p>

<p>“How foolish of you! He can always see me!” she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
replied indifferently. “Don’t scorn your food! It is
of an exceeding goodness. Bring me up to date a little
about yourself. Any more dark days?”</p>

<p>“No-o-o.”</p>

<p>She laughed at the prolongation of his denial.</p>

<p>“Come now! I’m beginning to think I’m of no use
to you!”</p>

<p>“Right now I’m as happy as a little lark!” he declared.</p>

<p>She had begun to suspect that he had known unhappiness.
A love affair perhaps. Or it might have been
the war that had taken something of the buoyancy of
youth out of him. She was happy in the thought that
she was able to help him. He was particularly responsive
to a kind of humor she herself enjoyed, and they
vied with each other in whimsical ridicule of the cubists
in art and the symbolists in literature.</p>

<p>... The guests were redistributing themselves and
she suggested that he single out Leila for a little attention.</p>

<p>“Don’t have prejudices! There’s nothing in that,”
she said.</p>

<p>“I haven’t a prejudice against Miss Mills!”</p>

<p>“Not so formal! I’ll give you permission to call her
Leila! She’ll like it!”</p>

<p>“But you haven’t told me I might call you——”</p>

<p>“Millicent let it be!”</p>

<p>“Well, little one, how’s your behavior!” demanded
Leila when Bruce found her.</p>

<p>“Bad!” Bruce replied in her own key.</p>

<p>“My example, I suppose. I’ve heard that I’m a bad
influence in the community. Let’s sit. You and I
have got to have an understanding some day; why not
now?”</p>

<p>“All right, but don’t get too deep—Leila!”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>“That’s good! I didn’t suppose you knew my name.
Millie’s put you up to that.”</p>

<p>“She did. I hope you like it.”</p>

<p>“Intensely! Are you falling in love with Millie?”</p>

<p>“That’s a secret. If I said I was, what would you
say?”</p>

<p>“Atta boy! But—I don’t think she is in love with
you.”</p>

<p>“Your penetration does you credit! I had thought
of her as perishing for the hour when I would again
dawn upon her sight!”</p>

<p>“You’re going good! Really, though, she admits
that she likes you ever so much.”</p>

<p>“Is that the reason why you think she doesn’t love
me?”</p>

<p>“Of course! I’m in love myself. I’m simply wild
about Freddy Thomas! But I’d die before I’d admit
the awful fact to my dearest friend! That’s love!”</p>

<p>“How about your Freddy? Is he aware of your
infatuation?”</p>

<p>“That’s the wonderful part. You see, it’s a secret.
No one knows it but just Freddy and me!”</p>

<p>“Oh, I see! You pretend to hate Freddy but really
you love him?”</p>

<p>“You’re a thinker! What would you say if I told
you I had a cute little flask upstairs and asked you to
meet me in the pantry and have a little nip just to celebrate
this event? I had only one cocktail; my dearest
Dada saw to that!”</p>

<p>“I’d meet you in the pantry and confiscate the flask!”</p>

<p>She regarded him fixedly for a moment, and her tone
and manner changed abruptly.</p>

<p>“You know about life, people, things; I know you
do! It’s in your eyes, and I’d know it if Millie
hadn’t said so. Do you really think it is disgraceful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
for me to get—well, soused—as you’ve seen me several
times? Dada and my aunts lecture me to death—and
I hate it—but, well—what do you think?”</p>

<p>Her gravity demanded kindness. He felt infinitely
older; she seemed very like a child tonight—an impulsive,
friendly child.</p>

<p>“I think I’d cut it out. There’s no good in it—for
you or anyone else.”</p>

<p>“I’ll consider that,” she replied slowly; then suddenly
restless, she suggested that they go into the long enclosed
veranda that connected the house with the conservatories.</p>

<p>As they walked back and forth—Leila in frivolous
humor now—Bruce caught a glimpse of her father and
Millicent just inside the conservatory door. They were
talking earnestly. Evidently they had paused to conclude
some matter they had been discussing before returning
to the house. Millicent held three roses in her
hand and lifted them occasionally to her face.</p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>Still beset by uncertainties as to whether he would
increase his chances of happiness by marrying again,
Mills was wondering just how a man of his years could
initiate a courtship with a girl of Millicent Harden’s
age. It must be managed in such a way as to preserve
his dignity—that must be preserved at all hazards.
They had been walking through the conservatory aisles
inspecting his roses, which were cultivated by an expert
whose salary was a large item of the farm budget.
Millicent was asking questions about the development
of new floral types and he was answering painstakingly,
pleased by her interest.</p>

<p>“It’s unfortunate that the human species can’t be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
improved as easily. At least we don’t see our way to
improving it,” he remarked.</p>

<p>He had never thought her so beautiful as now; her
charm was rather enhanced by her informal dress. It
would be quite possible for him to love her, love her
even with a young man’s ardor.</p>

<p>“Oh, patience, sir!” she smiled. “Evolution is still
going on.”</p>

<p>“Or going back! There’s our old quarrel!” he
laughed. “We always seem to get into it. But your
idea that we’re not creatures of chance—that there’s
some unseen power back of everything we call life—that’s
too much for me. I can understand Darwin—but
you!”</p>

<p>“Honestly, now, are you perfectly satisfied to go on
thinking we’re all creatures of chance?”</p>

<p>“Sometimes I am and then again I’m not!” he replied
with a shrug. “I can’t quite understand why it
is that with everything we have, money and the ability
to amuse ourselves, we do at times inquire about that
Something that never shows itself or gives us a word.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but He does!” She held up the three perfect
roses Mills had plucked for her. “He shows Himself
in all beautiful things. They’re all trying to tell us
that the Something we can’t see or touch has a great
deal to do with our lives.”</p>

<p>“Millie,” he said in a tone of mock despair, tapping
her hand lightly, “you’re an incorrigible mystic!”</p>

<p>They were interrupted by a knock on the glass door,
which swung open, disclosing Leila and Bruce.</p>

<p>“Mr. Storrs and I are dying of curiosity! You’ve
been talking here for ages!” cried Leila.</p>

<p>“Millie’s been amusing herself at my expense,” said
Mills. “Mr. Storrs, I wish you’d tell me sometime<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
what Miss Harden means when she reaches into the
infinite and brings down——”</p>

<p>“Roses!” laughed Millicent.</p>


<h3>V</h3>

<p>His glimpse of Franklin Mills and Millicent at the
conservatory door affected Bruce disagreeably. The
fact that the two had been discussing impersonal matters
did not lessen his resentment. Millicent with
Mills’s roses in her hand; Mills courteously attentive,
addressing the girl with what to Bruce was a lover-like
air, had made a picture that greatly disturbed him.</p>

<p>Very likely, with much this same air, with the same
winning manner and voice, Mills had wooed his mother!
He saw in Mills a sinister figure—a man who, having
taken advantage of one woman, was not to be trusted
with another. The pity he had at times felt for Mills
went down before a wave of jealous anger and righteous
indignation. The man was incapable of any true
appreciation of Millicent; he was without wit or soul
to penetrate to the pure depths of the girl’s nature.</p>

<p>“You two are always talking about things I don’t
understand!” Leila said to them; and led Bruce on
through the conservatories, talking in her inconsequential
fashion.</p>

<p>When they returned to the house someone had begun
playing old-fashioned games—blindman’s buff,
drop the handkerchief and London Bridge. When these
ceased to amuse, the rugs were cleared away and they
danced to the phonograph. Mills encouraged and participated
in all this as if anxious to show that he could
be as young as the youngest. And what occasion could
be more fitting than an evening in his handsome country<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
house, with his children and their friends about
him!</p>

<p>With Millicent constantly before his eyes, entering
zestfully into all these pleasures, Bruce recovered his
tranquillity. For the thousandth time he convinced
himself that he was not a weakling to suffer specters
of the past and forebodings of the future to mar his
life. He danced with Millicent; seized odd moments
in which to talk to her; tried to believe that she had a
particular smile for him....</p>

<p>“I wonder if you’d drive me in?” asked Mrs. Torrence
when the party began to break up.</p>

<p>“I’d been counting on it!” said Bruce promptly.</p>

<p>Constance came along and waived her rights to his
escort, as she and Shepherd were taking the Freemans
home.</p>

<p>“I believe we’re a little better acquainted than we
were,” she said meaningfully.</p>

<p>“It seemed to me we made a little headway,” Bruce
replied.</p>

<p>“Come and see me soon! You never can tell when
I’ll need a little consoling.”</p>

<p>“That was a good party,” Mrs. Torrence began as
Bruce got his car in motion. “Mr. Mills is two or
three different men. Sometimes I think he consciously
assumes a variety of rôles. He’s keen about this country
gentleman stuff—unassuming grandeur and all that!
But meet him out at dinner in town tomorrow night
and you’d never think him capable of playing drop the
handkerchief! Makes you wonder just which is the
real Mills.”</p>

<p>“Maybe we all lead two or three existences without
knowing it,” Bruce remarked.</p>

<p>“We do! We do, indeed!” the little woman cheerfully<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
agreed. “All except me. I’m always just the
same and too much of that!”</p>

<p>“Well, you always come up with a laugh and that
helps. Please let me into the secret.”</p>

<p>“My dear boy, I learned early in life to hide my tears.
Nobody’s interested in a cry-baby. And minding my
own business saves a lot of bother. I think I’ve
acquired that noble trait!”</p>

<p>“That’s genius!” exclaimed Bruce.</p>

<p>“But—in your case I may not do it! I like you, you
know.”</p>

<p>“Am I to believe that?” he asked seriously.</p>

<p>“I hope you’ll believe it. I offered at the beginning
of the evening to be your friend until death do us part;
I’ve done some thinking since. I do think occasionally,
though you’d never guess it.”</p>

<p>“It’s an old trick of the world to be mistrustful of
thinkers. I’ve suffered from it myself.”</p>

<p>“Listen to me, young man! I’ve got my eye on you.
I suggested to Connie that it would be simpler for her
to go in with Shep. I love Connie; she’s always been
nice to me. But Connie’s not just a safe chum for
you. Your fascinations might be a trifle too—too——”</p>

<p>“Too,” he supplied mockingly, “much for me?”</p>

<p>“Don’t be silly! Connie’s a young woman of charm,
and she likes to use it. And you’re not without a little
of the same ingredient. You may be nice and friendly
with Connie—<i>and</i> Shep—but you mustn’t forget that
there is Shep. Shep’s a nice, dear boy. I’m strong
for Shepherd. I could cry when I see how much in
love he is with Connie! And of course she doesn’t
love him in any such way. She sort o’ mothers and
pets him. She still has her grand love affair before
her. Isn’t this nasty of me to be talking of her in
this fashion! But I don’t want you to be the victim.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
One drive alone with her is enough for you in one
evening!”</p>

<p>“Oh, but——”</p>

<p>“Oh, all the buts! We haven’t been talking of her
at all! Aren’t the shadows of that tall tree interesting?”</p>

<p>The shadows of the tall tree were not particularly
interesting, but Bruce, speculating a little as to what
Mrs. Torrence would say if she knew he had kissed
Constance on the drive out, was guiltily glad that she
had concluded what he felt to be a well-meant warning
against getting in too deep with Mrs. Shepherd Mills.</p>

<p>“You’ve got a big future,” Mrs. Torrence remarked
later. “Nothing’s going to spoil it. But socially, walk
softly. This is a city of illusions. It’s the fashion to
pretend that everybody’s awfully good. Of course
everybody isn’t! But it’s better to fall in with the
idea. I’m just giving you the hint. Take Franklin
Mills for your model. Always know the right people
and do the right thing. There’s a man who never
sinned in all his life. You’re lucky to have caught his
eye so soon! I saw him watching you tonight—with
approval, I mean. He’s a man of power. I advise
you to cultivate him a little.”</p>

<p>“Oh, my knowing him is just a matter of chance,”
Bruce replied indifferently.</p>

<p>“He’s the most interesting man in town and all the
more so because he’s puzzling—not all on the surface.
An unusual person. And to think he has a daughter
like Leila and a son like Shep! I love them both;
they’re so unlike him! You wouldn’t know them for
the same breed. One couldn’t love <i>him</i>, you know;
he’s far too selfish and self-satisfied for that!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER TWELVE</h2>
</div>


<h3>I</h3>

<p>As Bruce was driving past the Mills’s residence one
evening several weeks later, Carroll hailed him. Mills,
it appeared, had driven out with Carroll and the limousine
waited at the curb to carry the secretary on home.
Carroll asked Bruce whether he would go with him to
a lecture at the art institute the following night; a
famous painter was to speak and it promised to be an
interesting occasion. Mills lingered while the young
men arranged to meet at the club for dinner before the
lecture, and Bruce was about to climb back into his
car when Mills said detainingly:</p>

<p>“Storrs, won’t you have pity on me? Carroll’s just
refused to dine with me. My daughter’s going out and
there’s just myself. Do you think you could stand it?”</p>

<p>“The soil of the day is upon me!” said Bruce.
“But——”</p>

<p>He very much wished to refuse, but the invitation
was cordially given, and taken by surprise, he was without
a valid excuse for declining.</p>

<p>“You don’t need to dress and you may leave the moment
you’re bored,” said Mills amiably.</p>

<p>“Sorry, but I’ve got to run,” said Carroll. “I’ll send
your car right back, Mr. Mills. Thank you. I envy
you two your quiet evening!”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>Mills led the way upstairs, opened the door of one
of the bedrooms and turned on the lights.</p>

<p>“The room’s supposed to be in order—it’s my son’s
old room. Ring if you don’t find what you want.”</p>

<p>Bruce closed the door and stared about him.</p>

<p>Shepherd’s old room! It was a commodious chamber,
handsomely furnished. The bath was a luxurious
affair. As he drew off his coat Bruce’s mind turned
back to his little room in the old frame house in Laconia;
the snowy window draperies his mother always
provided, and the other little tributes of her love, fashioned
by her own hands, that adorned the room in
which he had dreamed the long, long dreams of youth.
Through the dormer windows he had heard the first
bird song in the spring, and on stormy nights in winter
had sunk to sleep to the north wind’s hoarse shout
through the elms and maples in the yard.</p>

<p>“My son’s room!” Franklin Mills had said carelessly
as he turned away. The phrase still rang in Bruce’s
ears. Mills could not know; he could not even suspect!
No man would be callous enough to make such
a remark if he believed he was uttering it to an unrecognized
child of his own blood.</p>

<p>Bruce laved his face and brushed his hair and went
down the hall to the library where Mills had taken
him on the memorable night they met in the storm.
The portrait which had so disturbed Mills still hung in
its place. Bruce turned his back on it and took up the
evening newspapers.</p>

<p>A maid appeared to say that Mr. Mills was answering
a long-distance call, but would be free in a moment;
and a little later the butler came in with a tray and
began concocting a cocktail. While this was in
preparation a low whistle from the door caused Bruce<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
to glance round. Leila was peering at him, her head
alone being visible.</p>

<p>“I thought you were a burglar!” she whispered.</p>

<p>Bruce pointed to the servant, who was solemnly
manipulating the shaker, and beckoned her to enter.</p>

<p>“Briggs! You lied to me again!” she said severely
as she swept into the room. “You told me there wasn’t
a drop in the house!”</p>

<p>“It was the truth, Miss Leila, when I told you,” the
man replied gravely. “A friend of Mr. Mills left this
at the door this morning.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe it! It was more likely a friend of
mine. I say, little one, how do I look?”</p>

<p>“Queenly,” Bruce replied. “If you were more beautiful
my eyes couldn’t bear it.”</p>

<p>“Cut it! Am I really all right?”</p>

<p>“I’d be ashamed if I didn’t know it!”</p>

<p>“Good boy! You have a taste!”</p>

<p>She was charming indeed in her evening gown, which
he praised in ignorant terms that she might correct
him. She remained standing, drawing on her gloves,
and explaining that she was dining at the Tarletons and
wasn’t highly edified at the prospect. Her going was
a concession to her father. The Tarletons had a young
guest whose grandfather had once been a business associate
of her Grandfather Mills; hence she must sacrifice
herself.</p>

<p>“Dad’s keen about the old family stuff. Just look at
those grand old relics up there.” She indicated the line
of family portraits with a disdainful gesture. “I come
in and make faces at them when I feel naughty. I
can’t tell my grandfathers apart, and don’t want to!”</p>

<p>“How lacking in piety!” said Bruce, who could have
pointed out her Grandfather Mills! He bestowed a
hasty glance at the portrait, satisfied that Leila at least<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
would never detect her ancestor’s resemblance to himself.
The servant, having sufficiently agitated the
cocktails, withdrew. Leila, waiting till the door to the
back stairs closed, began advancing with long steps
and a rowdyish swagger toward the tray.</p>

<p>“Alone with a cocktail! And I’m going to a dry
party! Hist!” She bent her head toward the door,
her hand to her ear. “What’s the Colonel doing?” she
asked.</p>

<p>“At the telephone; he’ll be here any minute.”</p>

<p>“Quick! Fill that glass—that’s the good sport!”</p>

<p>“Service for two only! You wouldn’t rob <i>me</i>!”</p>

<p>“Please—I don’t want my gloves to reek of gin—please!”</p>

<p>“You can’t touch that tray—you can’t touch that
shaker! You’re hypnotized!” he declared solemnly.</p>

<p>“Oh, tush!” With a quick movement she tried to
grasp the shaker; but he caught her hand, held it a
moment, then let it fall to her side while he smiled into
her bright, eager eyes.</p>

<p>“In the name of all your ancestors I forbid you!”
he said.</p>

<p>“You wouldn’t trust me with one?” she demanded,
half defiant, half acquiescing.</p>

<p>“Not tonight, when you’re meeting old family
friends and all that!”</p>

<p>“Pshaw!” She stamped her foot. “I can stop at
half a dozen houses and get a drink——”</p>

<p>“But you won’t; really you won’t!”</p>

<p>“What’s it to you—why should you care?” she demanded,
looking him straight in the eyes.</p>

<p>“Aren’t we friends?” he asked. “A friend wouldn’t
give it to you. See! You don’t really want it at all—it
was just an hallucination!”</p>

<p>“Oh, no!” she said, puckering her face and scowling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
her abhorrence of the idea while her eyes danced merrily.
“I just <i>dreamed</i> I wanted it. Well, score one
for you, old top! You’re even nicer than I thought
you were!”</p>

<p>“Leila, haven’t you <i>gone</i> yet?” exclaimed Mills, appearing
suddenly in the room.</p>

<p>“No, Dada! I was just kidding Bruce a little. Hope
you have a nice dinner! Don’t be too solemn, and don’t
scold your guest the way you do me. Yes, I’ve got my
key and every little thing. Good-night. Come and see
me sometime, Bruce.” She lifted her face for her
father to kiss, paused in the doorway to shake her fist
at Bruce and tripped down the hall singing.</p>

<p>“Do pardon me for keeping you waiting,” said Mills.
“I had a New York call and the connection was bad.
Let’s see what we have here——”</p>

<p>“Allow me, sir——”</p>

<p>As Bruce gave the drinks a supplemental shake Mills
inspected the two glasses, ostensibly to satisfy himself
that the housekeeping staff had properly cared for
them, but really, Bruce surmised, to see whether Leila
had been tippling.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>When they went down to the dining-room Bruce
found it less of an ordeal than he had expected to sit
at Mills’s table. Mills was a social being; his courtesy
was unfailing, and no doubt he was sincere in his expressions
of gratitude to Bruce for sharing his meal.</p>

<p>The table was lighted by four tapers in tall candlesticks
of English silver. The centerpiece was a low
bowl of pink roses, the product of the Deer Trail conservatories.
Mills, in spite of his austere preferences
in other respects, deferred to changing fashions in the
furnishing of his table, to which he gave the smart<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
touch of a sophisticated woman. It was a way of amusing
himself, and he enjoyed the praise of the women
who dined with him for his taste, the discrimination he
exercised in picking up novelties in exclusive New York
shops. Even when alone he enjoyed the contemplation
of precious silver and crystal, and the old English china
in which he specialized. He invited Bruce’s attention,
as one connoisseur to another, to the graceful lines
and colors of the water glasses—a recent acquisition.
The food was excellent, but doubtless no better than
Mills ate every night, whether he dined alone or with
Leila. The courses were served unhurriedly; Franklin
Mills was not a man one could imagine bolting his food.
Again Bruce found his dislike ebbing. The idea that
the man was his father only fleetingly crossed his mind.
If Mills suspected the relationship he was an incomparable
actor....</p>

<p>“I’ve never warmed to the idea that America should
be an asylum for the scum of creation; it’s my Anglo-Saxon
conceit, I suppose. You have the look of the
old American stock——”</p>

<p>“I suppose I’m a pretty fair American,” Bruce replied.
“My home town is Laconia—settled by Revolutionary
soldiers; they left their imprint. It’s a patriotic
community.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes; Laconia! Carroll was telling me that had
been your home. He has some relatives there himself.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know them,” Bruce said, meeting Mills’s
gaze carelessly. “The fact is I know, or used to know,
nearly everybody in the town.”</p>

<p>“Carroll may have told you that I had some acquaintance
with the place myself. That was a long time ago.
I went there to look after some business interests for
my father. It was a part of my apprenticeship. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
seem to recall people of your name; Storrs is not so
common—?”</p>

<p>“My father was John Storrs—a lawyer,” said Bruce
in the tone of one stating a fact unlikely to be of particular
interest.</p>

<p>“Yes; John Storrs——” Mills repeated musingly.
“I recall him very well—and his wife—your mother—of
course. Delightful people. I’ve always remembered
those months I spent there with a particular pleasure.
For the small place Laconia was then, there was a good
deal doing—dances and picnics. I remember your
mother as the leading spirit in all the social affairs. Is
she——”</p>

<p>“Father and mother are both gone. My mother died
a little more than a year ago.”</p>

<p>“I’m very sorry,” Mills murmured sympathetically.
“For years I had hoped to go back to renew old acquaintances,
but Laconia is a little inaccessible from
here and I never found it possible.”</p>

<p>Whether Mills had referred to his temporary residence
in Laconia merely to show how unimportant and
incidental it was in his life remained a question. But
Bruce felt that if Mills could so lightly touch upon it,
he himself was equal to gliding over it with like indifference.
Mills asked with a smile whether Gardner’s
Grove was still in existence, that having been a favorite
picnic ground, an amateurish sort of country club
where the Laconians used to have their dances. The
oak trees there were the noblest he had ever seen. Bruce
expressed regret that the grove was gone....</p>

<p>Mills was shrewd; and Bruce was aware that the
finely formed head across the table housed a mind that
carefully calculated all the chances of life even into the
smallest details. He wondered whether he had borne
himself as well as Mills in the ordeal. The advantage<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
had been on Mills’s side; it was his house, his table.
Possibly he had been waiting for some such opportunity
as this to sound the son of Marian Storrs as to
what he knew—hoped perhaps to surprise him into
some disclosure of the fact if she had ever, in a moment
of weakness or folly, spoken of him as other
than a passing acquaintance.</p>

<p>“We’ll go down to the billiard room to smoke,”
Mills remarked at the end of the dinner. “We’ll have
our coffee there.”</p>

<p>Easy chairs and a davenport at one end of the billiard
room invited to comfort. On the walls were
mounted animal heads and photographs of famous
horses.</p>

<p>“Leila doesn’t approve of these works of art,” said
Mills, seeing Bruce inspecting them. “She thinks I
ought to move them to the farm. They do look out
of place here. Sit where you like.”</p>

<p>He half sprawled on the davenport as one who, having
dined to his satisfaction and being consequently on
good terms with the world, wishes to set an example
of informality to a guest. Bruce wondered what Mills
did on evenings he spent alone in the big house; tried
to visualize the domestic scene in the years of Mrs.
Mills’s life.</p>

<p>“You see Shepherd occasionally?” Mills asked when
the coffee had been served. “The boy hasn’t quite
found himself yet. Young men these days have more
problems to solve than we faced when I was your age.
Everything is more complicated—society, politics,
everything. Maybe it only seems so. Shep’s got a lot
of ideas that seem wild to me. Can’t imagine where
he gets them. Social reforms and all that. I sometimes
think I made a mistake in putting him into business.
He might have been happier in one of the professions—had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
an idea once he wanted to be a doctor,
but I discouraged it. A mistake, perhaps.”</p>

<p>Mills’s manner of speaking of Shepherd was touched
with a certain remoteness. He appeared to invite
Bruce’s comment, not in a spirit of sudden intimacy,
but as if he were talking with a man of his own years
who was capable of understanding his perplexities.
It seemed to Bruce in those few minutes that he had
known Franklin Mills a very long time. He was finding
it difficult to conceal his embarrassment under
equivocal murmurs. But he pulled himself together
to say cordially:</p>

<p>“Shepherd is a fine fellow, Mr. Mills. You can’t
blame him for his idealism. There’s a lot of it in the
air.”</p>

<p>“He was not cut out for business,” Mills remarked.
“Business is a battle these days, and Shep isn’t a
fighter.”</p>

<p>“Must the game be played in that spirit?” asked
Bruce with a smile.</p>

<p>“Yes, if you want to get anywhere,” Mills replied
grimly. “Shall we do some billiards?”</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>Mills took his billiards seriously. It was, Bruce
could see, a pastime much to his host’s taste; it exercised
his faculties of quick calculation and deft execution.
Mills explained that he had employed a professional
to teach him. He handled the cue with
remarkable dexterity; it was a pleasure to watch the
ease and grace of his playing. Several times, after a
long run, he made a wild shot, unnecessarily it seemed,
and out of keeping with his habitual even play. Bud
Henderson had spoken of this peculiarity. Bruce wondered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
whether it was due to fatigue or to the intrusion
upon Mills’s thoughts of some business matter
that had caused a temporary break in the unity of eye
and hand. Or it might have been due to some decision
that had been crystallizing in his subconsciousness
and manifested itself in this odd way. Mills was
too good a player to make a fluke intentionally, merely
to favor a less skillful opponent. He accepted his ill
fortune philosophically. He was not a man to grow
fretful or attempt to explain his errors.</p>

<p>“We’re not so badly matched,” he remarked when
they finished and he had won by a narrow margin.
“You play a good game.”</p>

<p>“You got the best there was in me!” said Bruce. “I
rarely do as well as that.”</p>

<p>“Let’s rest and have a drink.” Mills pressed a button.
“I’m just tired enough to want to sit awhile.”</p>

<p>Bruce had expected to leave when the game was
ended, but Mills gave him no opportunity. He reestablished
himself on the davenport and began talking
more desultorily than before. For a time, indeed,
Bruce carried the burden of the conversation. Some
remark he let fall about the South caused Mills to ask
him whether he had traveled much in America.</p>

<p>“I’ve walked over a lot of it,” Bruce replied. “That
was after I came back from the little splurge overseas.
Gave myself a personally conducted tour, so to speak.
Met lots of real tramps. I stopped to work occasionally—learned
something that way.”</p>

<p>Mills was at once interested. He began asking questions
as to the living conditions of the people encountered
in this adventure and the frame of mind of the
laborers Bruce had encountered.</p>

<p>“You found the experience broadening, of course.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
It’s a pity more of us can’t learn of life by direct contact
with the people.”</p>

<p>Under Mills’s questioning the whole thing seemed to
Bruce more interesting than he had previously thought
it. The real reason for his long tramp—the fact that
he had taken to the road to adjust himself to his
mother’s confession that he was the son of a man of
whom he had never heard—would probably have given
Mills a distinct shock.</p>

<p>“I wish I could have done that myself!” Mills kept
saying.</p>

<p>Bruce was sorry that he had stumbled into the
thing. Mills was sincerely curious; it was something
of an event to hear first-hand of such an experience.
His questions were well put and required careful answers.
Bruce found himself anxious to appear well
in Mills’s eyes. But Mills was leading toward something.
He was commenting now on the opportunities
open to young men of ability in the business world,
with Bruce’s experiences as a text.</p>

<p>“A professional man is circumscribed. There’s a
limit to his earning power. Most men in the professions
haven’t the knack of making money. They’re
usually unwise in the investments they make of their
savings.”</p>

<p>“But they have the joy of their work,” Bruce replied
quickly. “We can’t measure their success just by
their income.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I grant you that! But many of the doors
of prosperity and happiness are denied them.”</p>

<p>“But others are open! Think of the sense of service
a physician must feel in helping and saving. And even
a puttering architect who can’t create masterpieces has
the fun of doing his small jobs well. He lives the
life he wants to live. There are painters and musicians<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
who know they can never reach the high places;
but they live the life! They starve and are happy!”</p>

<p>Bruce bent forward eagerly, the enthusiasm bright
in his eyes. He had not before addressed Mills with
so much assurance. The man was a materialist; his
standards were fixed in dollars. It was because he
reckoned life in false terms that Shepherd was afraid
of him.</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t misunderstand me! I realize the diversity
of talents that are handed out to us poor mortals.
But if you were tempted to become a painter, say, and
you knew you would never be better than second-rate,
and at the same time you were pretty sure you could
succeed in some business and live comfortably—travel,
push into the big world currents and be a man of
mark—what would you do?”</p>

<p>“Your question isn’t fair, because it’s not in the
design of things for us to see very far ahead. But
I’ll answer! If I had a real urge to paint I’d go to it
and take my chance.”</p>

<p>“That’s a fine spirit, Storrs; and I believe you mean
it. But——”</p>

<p>Mills rose and, thrusting his hands into his trousers’
pockets, walked across the room, his head bent, and
then swung round, took the cigar from his lips and
regarded the ash fixedly.</p>

<p>“Now,” he said, “don’t think me ungracious”—he
smiled benignantly—“but I’m going to test you. I happen
right now to know of several openings in financial
and industrial concerns for just such a young man as
you. They are places calling for clear judgment and
executive talent such as I’d say you possess. The
chances of getting on and up would be good, even if
you had no capital. Would you care to consider these
places?”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>The smile had faded from his face; he waited
gravely, with a scarcely perceptible eagerness in his
eyes, for the answer.</p>

<p>“I think not, sir. No, Mr. Mills, I’m quite sure
of it.” And then, thinking that his rejection of the
offer was too abrupt and not sufficiently appreciative,
Bruce added: “You see, I’m going to make a strong
effort to get close to the top in my profession. I may
fall off the ladder, but—I’ll catch somewhere! I have
a little money—enough to tide me over bad times—and
I know I’d be sorry if I quit right at the start. It’s
kind of you to make the suggestion. I assure you I’m
grateful—it’s certainly very kind of you!”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m wholly selfish in suggesting it! In my
various interests we have trouble finding young men
of the best sort. I know nothing of your circumstances,
of course; but I thought maybe a promising
business opening would appeal to you. On the whole”—Mills
was still standing, regarding Bruce fixedly as
though trying to accommodate himself to some newly
discovered quality in his guest—“I like to see a young
man with confidence in his own powers. Yours is the
spirit that wins. I hope you won’t take it amiss that
I broached the matter. You have your engaging personality
to blame for that!”</p>

<p>“I’m glad to know it isn’t a liability!” said Bruce;
and this ended the discussion.</p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>He left the house with his mind in confusion as to
the meaning of Mills’s offer. He drove about for an
hour, pondering it, reviewing the whole evening from
the first mention of Laconia to the suggestion, with its
plausible inadvertence, that business openings might be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>
found for him. Mills was hardly the man to make
such a proposition to a comparative stranger without
reason. The very manner in which he had approached
the subject was significant. <i>Mills knew!</i> If he didn’t
know, at least his suspicions were strongly aroused.
Either his conscience was troubling him and he wished
to quiet it by a display of generosity, or he was anxious
to establish an obligation that would reduce to the
minimum the chance that any demand might be made
upon him. Bruce was glad to be in a position to refuse
Mills’s help; his mother’s care and self-denial had made
it unnecessary for him to abase himself by accepting
Mills’s bounty.</p>

<p>He wished he knew some way of making Mills understand
that he was in no danger; that any fears of
exposure he might entertain were groundless. His
pride rose strong in him as he reviewed his hours spent
with Mills. He had not acquitted himself badly; he had
forced Mills to respect him, and this was a point worth
establishing. When finally he fell asleep it was with
satisfaction,—a comforting sense of his independence
and complete self-mastery.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER THIRTEEN</h2>
</div>


<h3>I</h3>

<p>Mills, too, though lately mistrustful of his own emotions,
was well satisfied with the result of the long
evening. He had spoken of Marian Storrs to Marian’s
son and the effect had been to strengthen his belief that
the young man knew nothing that could in any way
prove annoying. He was a little sorry that he had
suggested finding a business opening for Storrs; but
decided that on the whole he had managed the matter
in a manner to conceal his real purpose. Bruce had
said that he was not wholly dependent upon his earnings
for a livelihood, and this in itself was reassuring
and weighed strongly against the possibility of his ever
asserting any claim even if he knew or suspected their
relationship.</p>

<p>In his careful study of Bruce at their various meetings
Mills had been impressed increasingly by the
young man’s high-mindedness, his self-confidence and
fine reticences, the variety and range of his interests.
Ah, if only Shepherd were like that! It was a cruel
fate that had given him a son he could never own,
who had drifted across the smooth-flowing current of
his life to suggest a thousand contrasts with Shepherd
Mills—Shep with his pathetically small figure, his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>
absurd notions of social equality and his inability to
grasp and deal with large affairs!</p>

<p>Ugly as the fact was, Bruce Storrs was a Mills; it
wasn’t merely in the resemblance to the portrait of
Franklin Mills III that this was evident. Young
Storrs’s mental processes were much like those of the
man who was, to face it frankly, his grandfather.
Bruce Storrs, who had no right to the Mills name, was
likely to develop those traits that had endeared Franklin
Mills III to the community—traits that nature, with
strange perversity, had failed utterly to transmit to
his lawful son.</p>

<p>Mills, in his new security, pondered these things with
a degree of awe. The God in whom he had much
less faith than in a protective tariff or a sound currency
system might really be a more potent agent in
mundane affairs than he, Franklin Mills, who believed
in nothing very strongly that couldn’t be reduced to figures,
had ever thought possible.</p>

<p>As winter gripped the town Mills was uneasy in the
thought that he wasn’t getting enough out of life. Even
with eight million dollars and the tastes of a cultivated
gentleman, life was paying inadequate dividends. And
there across the hedge lived Millicent. He would
marry Millicent; but there were matters to be arranged
first....</p>

<p>Millicent was the most beautiful young woman he
knew, and she had brains and talents that added enormously
to her desirability. Against this was the fact
that the Hardens had risen out of nowhere, and Millicent’s
possession of a father and mother could not be
ignored. Their very simplicity and the possession of
the homely parochial virtues so highly valued in the
community by Mills and his generation made it possible
to do something toward giving them a social status.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>Discreet inquiry revealed the consoling fact that
Nathaniel Harden was taxed on approximately a million
dollars’ worth of property. Not for nothing had he applied
himself diligently for twenty-five years to the
manufacture of the asthma cure! He was also the
creator of a hair tonic, a liver accelerator and a liniment
that were almost as well established in the proprietary
drug market as the asthma remedy. Mills was amazed
to find that there was so much money in the business.</p>

<p>Harden had not brought his laboratory with him
when he moved to the city, but it was still under his
own direction. Fortunately, as Mills viewed the matter,
the business was conducted under a corporate title,
that of the International Medical Company, which was
much less objectionable than if it bore Harden’s name,
though the doctor’s picture did, regrettably, adorn the
bottles in which the world-famous asthma cure was
offered and exposed for sale.</p>

<p>In his investigations Mills found that Harden had
invested his money in some of the soundest of local
securities. It spoke well for the Doctor’s business
acumen that he owned stock in the First National
Bank, which Mills controlled. A vacancy occurring in
the directorate, Mills caused Harden to be elected to
the board. Harden was pleased but not overcome by
the honor. Mrs. Harden manifested a greater pleasure
and expressed herself to Mills with characteristic
heartiness.</p>

<p>Mills, after much careful consideration, gave a dinner
for Doctor and Mrs. Harden—made it appear to
be a neighborly affair, though he was careful to ask
only persons whose recognition of the Hardens was
likely to add to their prestige. Mills had rather dreaded
seeing Harden in a dress suit, but the Doctor clad in
social vestments was nothing to be ashamed of. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
revealed a sense of humor and related several stories
of a former congressman from his old district that
were really funny. Mrs. Harden looked as well and
conducted herself with quite as much ease as the other
women present. No one would have guessed that she
made salt-rising bread once a week for her husband’s
delectation and otherwise continued, in spite of her
prosperous state, to keep in close touch with her kitchen.</p>

<p>After giving the dinner Mills waited a little before
venturing further in his attempt to lift the social sky
line for the Hardens. Much as he disliked Constance,
he was just the least bit afraid of her. Constance was
not stupid, and he was not blind to the fact that she
wielded a certain influence. His daughter-in-law could
easily further his plans for imparting dignity to the
Hardens. And he foresaw that if he married again
it would be Connie, not Shepherd or Leila, who would
resent the marriage as a complicating circumstance
when the dread hour arrived for the parceling of his
estate. Leila would probably see little more than a
joke in a marriage that would make her best friend
her stepmother.</p>

<p>“Why isn’t Millie in the Dramatic Club?” he asked
Leila one day when they were dining alone together.</p>

<p>“Not so easy, Dada. I talked to some of the membership
committee about it last spring and I have a
sneaking idea that they don’t want her. Not just that,
of course; it’s not Millie but the patent medicine they
can’t swallow. I think the club’s a bore myself.
There’s a bunch of girls in it—Connie’s one of them—who
think they’re Ethel Barrymores and Jane Cowlses,
and Millie, you know, might be a dangerous rival.
Which she would be, all right! So they kid themselves
with the idea that the club really stands for the real old<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
graveyard society of our little village and that they’ve
got to be careful who gets by.”</p>

<p>“How ridiculous!” Mills murmured.</p>

<p>“Silly! I do hate snobs! Millie isn’t asked to a
lot of the nicest parties just because she’s new in town.
Doctor Harden’s guyed a good deal about his fake
medicines. I don’t see anything wrong with Doc myself.”
Leila bent her head in a quick way she had
when mirth seized her. “Bud Henderson says the
Harden hair tonic’s the smoothest furniture polish on
the market.”</p>

<p>Mills laughed, but not heartily. The thought of
Henderson’s ridicule chilled him. Henderson entertained
a wide audience with his humor; he must be
cautious....</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>Leila was an impossible young democrat, utterly devoid
of the sense of social values. He must make an
ally of Constance. Connie always wanted something;
it was one of Connie’s weaknesses to want things.
Connie’s birthday falling in the second week in December
gave him a hint. Leila had mentioned the anniversary
and reminded her father that he usually made
Connie a present. Connie expected presents and was
not satisfied with anything cheap.</p>

<p>Mills had asked a New York jeweler to send out
some pearls from which to make a selection for a
Christmas present for Leila. They were still in his
vault at the office. He chose from the assortment a
string of pearls with a diamond pendant and bestowed
it upon his daughter-in-law on the morning of her
birthday. He had made her handsome presents before,
but nothing that pleased her so much as this.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>While Connie’s gratitude was still warm, Mills found
occasion to mention Millicent one evening when he was
dining at Shepherd’s. Leila had been asked to some
function to which Millicent was not bidden. Mills
made the very natural comment that it was unfortunate
that Millicent, intimate as she was with Leila, could
not share all her pleasures; the discrimination against
the Hardens’ daughter was unjust. Quick to see what
was expected of her, Constance replied that it was
Millicent’s own fault that she hadn’t been taken up
more generally. It was perhaps out of loyalty to her
parents that she had not met more responsively the
advances of women who, willing to accept Millicent,
yet couldn’t quite see her father and mother in the
social picture. Now that she thought of it, Constance
herself had never called on Mrs. Harden, but she
would do so at once. There was no reason at all why
Millicent shouldn’t be admitted to the Dramatic Club;
she would see to that. She thought the impression had
got around that Millicent was, if not Bohemian in her
sympathies, at least something of a nonconformist in
her social ideas. It was her artistic nature, perhaps.</p>

<p>“That’s nonsense,” said Mills. “There isn’t a better
bred girl in town. She’s studious, quite an intellectual
young woman—but that’s hardly against her.
I always feel safe about Leila when I know she and
Millicent are together. And her father and mother
are really very nice—unpretentious, kindly people. Of
course the patent medicine business isn’t looked on
with great favor—but——”</p>

<p>“But—it’s about as respectable as canning our native
corn or cutting up pigs,” Constance suggested.</p>

<p>She was bewildered to find Mills, who had looked
askance at her own claims to social recognition because
her father’s real estate and insurance business was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
rather insignificant, suddenly viewing the asthma cure
so tolerantly. However, a father-in-law who gave her
valuable presents must be humored in his sudden
manifestation of contempt for snobbery. This was the
first time Mills had ever shown any disposition to
recognize her social influence. No matter what had
caused his change of heart, it was flattering to her
self-esteem that he was, even so indirectly, asking her
aid. She liked Millicent well enough and gladly promised
to help her along.</p>

<p>When Mills left she asked Shepherd what he thought
was in the wind; but he failed to be aroused by the
suggestion that his father might be thinking of marrying
Millicent. His father would never marry again,
Shepherd insisted; certainly not unless he found a
woman of suitable age, for companionship and to promote
his comfort when Leila was settled.</p>

<p>“You don’t know your father any better than I do,
Shep. He always has a motive for everything he
does—you may be sure of that!”</p>

<p>“Father means to be just and kind,” said Shepherd,
half-heartedly, as if he were repeating a formula in
which he didn’t believe.</p>

<p>“When he’s moved to be generous he certainly lets
go with a free hand,” Constance remarked. “That
necklace wasn’t cheap. I’m afraid it wasn’t just a
spontaneous outburst of affection for me. I think I
owe it to Millicent!”</p>

<p>“Oh, father likes you, Connie. You’re foolish to
think he doesn’t,” Shepherd replied defensively.</p>

<p>“I think your father’s getting nervous about Leila.
He’s set his heart on having Carroll in the family.
But Arthur’s too old. Leila ought to marry a younger
man. Your father’s been suspecting me of promoting
her little affair with Freddy Thomas—I’ve seen it in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
his eye. But I don’t think she’s serious about that.
She says she’s crazy about him, but as she tells everyone,
it doesn’t mean anything.”</p>

<p>“Thomas—no,” Shepherd replied slowly. “I
shouldn’t be for that myself. I don’t like the idea of
her marrying a divorced man. Arthur would be quite
fine, I think. He’s a gentleman and he understands
Leila. The man who marries her has got to understand
her—make a lot of allowances.”</p>

<p>Constance smiled her amusement at his display of
sagacity.</p>

<p>“Wrong again, Shep! Leila will settle down and be
the tamest little matron in town. She seems to have
cut out her drinking. That was more for effect than
anything else. She’s got about all the fun to be had out
of making people think her a perfect little devil. By
the way, speaking of marrying men, that young Storrs
is a nice fellow—rather impressive. I think Leila’s a
little tempted to try her hand at flirting with him.
She was at the Henderson’s yesterday afternoon and
Bud was shaking up some cocktails. Mr. Storrs came
in and Leila refused to drink. She joked about it, but
said he had made her promise to quit. He’s not a
prig, but he knows the danger line when he sees it.”</p>

<p>“Yes—yes,” Shepherd assented eagerly. “He’s one
of the most attractive men I ever met. He’s the kind
of fellow you’d trust with anything you’ve got!”</p>

<p>“Yes—and be safe,” Constance replied. “He’s
hardly likely to do anything rash.”</p>

<p>They came again, as they often did, to a discussion
of Franklin Mills.</p>

<p>“Your father’s the great unaccountable,” sighed
Constance. “I long since gave up trying to understand
him. He’s a master hand at dodging round things
that don’t strike him just right. The way he turned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
down your clubhouse scheme was just like him; and
the way he spurned my little suggestion about buying
a summer place. By the way, what are you doing
about the clubhouse? I thought you were selling your
Rogers Trust stock to get money to build it. You
haven’t weakened, have you, Shep?”</p>

<p>“No! certainly not. I’m going ahead as soon as the
weather opens up. I sold my stock yesterday and I
mean to do the thing right. When I was in Chicago
last week I looked at a number of community houses
and got a lot of ideas.”</p>

<p>“Well, don’t get cold feet. That thing has worried
you a lot. I’d do it or I’d forget it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m going to do it all right!” Shepherd replied
jauntily. He greatly wished her to think him possessed
of the courage and initiative to carry through
large projects no matter how formidable the opposition.</p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>Franklin Mills was now on better terms with himself
than at any time since Bruce Storrs’s appearance
in town. Open weather had made it possible for him
to go to Deer Trail once or twice a week for a ride,
and he walked several miles every day. Leila had
agreed to accompany him on a trip to Bermuda the
first of February. In his absence the machinery he had
set in motion would be projecting the Hardens a little
further into the social limelight without his appearing
to be concerned in it.</p>

<p>He was hoping that the trip would serve effectually
to break off Thomas’s attentions to Leila, and that
within the next year he would see her engaged to Carroll.
Leila couldn’t be driven; to attempt to force the
thing would be disastrous. But the thought of her
marrying Thomas, a divorced man, was abhorrent,
while Carroll was in all ways acceptable. What Shepherd
lacked in force and experience, Carroll would
bring into the family. Mills was annoyed that he had
ever entertained a thought that he could be denied anything
in life that he greatly coveted, or deprived of the
comfort and peace he had so long enjoyed. He would
prolong his Indian Summer; his last years should be
his happiest.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>He enjoyed the knowledge that he exercised, with
so little trouble to himself, a real power in the community.
In a directors’ meeting no one spoke with
quite his authoritative voice. No other business man
in town was so thoroughly informed in finance and
economics as he. He viewed the life of his city with
the tranquil delight of a biologist who in the quiet
of his laboratory studies specimens that have been
brought to the slide without any effort on his own
part. And Mills liked to see men squirm—silly men
who overreached themselves, pretentious upstarts who
gestured a great deal with a minimum of accomplishment.
Blessed with both brains and money, he derived
the keenest satisfaction in screening himself from contact
with the vulgar while he participated in the game
like an invisible master chess player....</p>

<p>Doctor Lindley had asked him to come in to St.
Barnabas to look at the Mills Memorial window, which
had been restored with Mills’s money. He stopped on
his way to the office a few days before Christmas and
found Lindley busy in his study. They went into the
church and inspected the window, which was quite as
good as new. While they were viewing it Mrs. Torrence
came in, her vivacity subdued to the spirit of
the place. She was on a committee to provide the
Christmas decorations.</p>

<p>“You’re just the man I want to see,” she said to
Mills. “I was going to call you up. There’s some
stuff in your greenhouses I could use if you don’t
mind.”</p>

<p>“Anything I’ve got! Tell me what you want and
I’ll have the people at the farm deliver it.”</p>

<p>“That’s fine! I knew you’d be glad to help. The
florists are such robbers at Christmas.” She scribbled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>
a memorandum of her needs on an envelope and left
them.</p>

<p>Mills stood with his hand resting on the Mills pew
for a last glance at the transept window. The church,
which had survived all the changes compelled by the
growth of the city, was to Mills less of a holy place
than a monument to the past. His grandfather and
father had been buried from the church; here he had
been married, and here Shepherd and Leila had been
baptized. Leila would want a church wedding....
His thoughts transcribed a swift circle; then, remembering
that the rector was waiting, he followed him
into the vestry.</p>

<p>“Can’t you come in for a talk?” asked Lindley after
Mills had expressed his gratification that the window
had been repaired so successfully.</p>

<p>“No; I see there are people waiting for you.” Mills
glanced at a row of men and women of all ages—a
discouraged-looking company ranged along the wall
outside the study door. One woman with a shawl over
her head coughed hideously as she tried to quiet a dirty
child. “These people want advice or other help? I
suppose there’s no end to your work.”</p>

<p>“It’s my business to help them,” the rector replied.
“They’re all strangers—I never saw any of them before.
I rather like that—their sense of the church
standing ready to help them.”</p>

<p>“If they ask for money, what do you do?” asked
Mills practically. “Is there a fund?”</p>

<p>“Well, I have a contingency fund—yes. Being here
in the business district, I have constant calls that I
don’t feel like turning over to the charity society. I
deal with them right here the best I can. I make mistakes,
of course.”</p>

<p>“How much have you in hand now?” Mills asked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>
bluntly. The bedraggled child had begun to whimper,
and the mother, in hoarse whispers, was attempting
to silence it.</p>

<p>“Well, I did have about four dollars,” laughed Lindley,
“but Mrs. Torrence handed me a hundred this
morning.”</p>

<p>“I’ll send you a check for a thousand for these
emergency cases. When it gets low again, let me
know.”</p>

<p>“That’s fine, Mills! I can cheer a good many souls
with a thousand dollars. This is generous of you, indeed!”</p>

<p>“Oh—Lindley!” Mills had reached the street door
when he paused and retraced his steps. “Just a word—sometime
ago in my office I talked to you in a way I’ve
regretted. I’m afraid I wasn’t quite—quite just, to
you and the church—to organized religion. I realize,
of course, that the church——”</p>

<p>“The church,” said Lindley smilingly, “the church
isn’t these walls; it’s here!” He tapped his breast
lightly. “It’s in your heart and mine.”</p>

<p>“That really simplifies the whole thing!” Mills replied,
and with a little laugh he went on to his office.</p>

<p>He thought it fine of the minister to give audience
to the melancholy suppliants who sought him for alms
and counsel. He didn’t envy Lindley his job, but it
had to be done by someone. Lindley was really a very
good fellow indeed, Mills reflected—a useful man in
the community, and not merely an agreeable table companion
and witty after-dinner speaker.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>Before he read his mail Mills dispatched the check
for a thousand dollars by special messenger. It was a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
pleasure to help Lindley in his work. A man who had
to deal with such unpleasant specimens of humanity
as collected at Lindley’s door shouldn’t be disregarded.
He remembered having seen Lindley driving about in
a rattletrap machine that was a disgrace to the parish
and the town. It was a reflection upon St. Barnabas
that its rector was obliged to go about his errands in
so disreputable a car.</p>

<p>When Carroll came in with some reports Mills told
him to see Henderson and order a Plantagenet for
Lindley to be delivered at the clergyman’s house Christmas
morning.</p>

<p>Carroll reported a court decision in Illinois sustaining
the validity of some municipal bonds in which Mills
had invested.</p>

<p>“Christmas presents coming in early,” Mills remarked
as he read the telegram. “I thought I was
stung there.”</p>

<p>He approved of the world and its ways. It was a
pretty good world, after all; a world in which he
wielded power, as he liked to wield it, quietly, without
subjecting himself to the fever and fret of the market
place. Among other memoranda Carroll had placed
on his desk was a list of women—old friends of Mrs.
Mills—to whom he had sent flowers every Christmas
since her death. The list was kept in the office files
from year to year to guard against omissions. Sentiment.
Mills liked to believe himself singularly blessed
with sentiment. He admired himself for this fidelity
to his wife’s old friends. They probably spoke to one
another of these annual remembrances as an evidence
of the praiseworthy feeling he entertained for the
old times.</p>

<p>“You told me to keep on picking up Rogers Trust
whenever it was in the market,” said Carroll. “Gurley<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
called up yesterday and asked if you wanted any
more. I’ve got two hundred shares here—paid three
eighteen. They’re closing the transfer books tomorrow
so I went ahead without consulting you.”</p>

<p>“That part of it’s all right,” Mills remarked, scanning
the certificate. “Who’s selling this?”</p>

<p>“It was in Gurley’s name—he’d bought it himself.”</p>

<p>“A little queer,” Mills remarked. “There were only
a few old stockholders who had blocks of two hundred—Larsen,
Skinner, Saintsbury; and Shep and Leila
had the same amount. None of them would be selling
now. Suppose you step over to the Trust Company
and see where Gurley got this. It makes no particular
difference—I’m just a little curious. There’s been no
talk about the merger—no gossip?”</p>

<p>“Nothing that I’ve heard. I’m pretty sure Gurley
had no inkling of it. If he had, of course he wouldn’t
have let go at the price he asked.”</p>

<p>When Carroll went out Mills took a turn across the
floor. Before resuming his chair he stood for a moment
at the window looking off toward the low hills
vaguely limned on the horizon. His mood had changed.
He greatly disliked to be puzzled. And he was unable
to account for the fact that Gurley, a broker with
whom he rarely transacted any business, had become
possessed of two hundred shares of Roger Trust just
at this time.</p>

<p>Larsen, Skinner and Saintsbury were all in the secret
of the impending merger with the Central States Company.
There was Shepherd; he hadn’t told Shepherd,
but there had been no reason why he should tell Shepherd
any more than he would have made a confidante
of Leila, who probably had forgotten that she owned
the stock. Having acquired two-thirds of the Rogers
shares, all that was necessary was to call a meeting of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>
the stockholders and put the thing through in accordance
with the formula already carefully prepared by
his lawyers.</p>

<p>When Carroll came back he placed a memorandum
on Mills’s desk and started to leave the room.</p>

<p>“Just a moment, Carroll”—Mills eyed the paper
carefully. “So it was Shep who sold to Gurley—is
that right?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” Carroll assented. “Gurley only held it a day
before he offered it to me.”</p>

<p>“Shepherd—um—did Shep tell you he wanted to
sell?”</p>

<p>“No; he never mentioned it,” Carroll replied, not
relishing Mills’s inquiries.</p>

<p>“Call Shep and tell him to stop in this afternoon
on his way home, and—Carroll”—Mills detained his
secretary to impress him with his perfect equanimity—“call
Mrs. Rawlings and ask how the Judge is. I
understand he’s had a second stroke. I hate to see
these older men going——”</p>

<p>“Yes, the Judge has been a great figure,” Carroll
replied perfunctorily.</p>

<p>Carroll was troubled. He was fond of Shepherd
Mills, recognized the young man’s fine qualities and
sympathized with his high aims. There was something
pitiful in the inability of father and son to understand
each other. And he was not deceived by Franklin
Mills’s characteristic attempt to conceal his displeasure
at Shepherd’s sale of the stock.</p>

<p>It was evident from the manner in which the stock
had passed through Gurley’s hands that Shepherd
wished to hide the fact that he was selling. Poor
Shep! There could have been no better illustration of
his failure to understand his father than this. Carroll
had watched much keener men than Shepherd Mills<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>
attempt to deceive Franklin Mills. Just why Shepherd
should have sold the stock Carroll couldn’t imagine.
Constance had, perhaps, been overreaching herself. No
matter what had prompted the sale, Mills would undoubtedly
make Shepherd uncomfortable about it—not
explosively, for Mills never lost his perfect self-control—but
with his own suave but effective method. Carroll
wished there were something he could do to save
Shep from the consequences of his folly in attempting
to hide from Franklin Mills a transaction so obviously
impossible of concealment.</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>Shepherd entered his father’s office as he always did,
nervous and apprehensive.</p>

<p>“Well, Father, how’s everything with you today?”
he asked with feigned ease.</p>

<p>“All right, Shep,” Mills replied pleasantly as he continued
signing letters. “Everything all right at the
plant?”</p>

<p>“Everything running smoothly, Father.”</p>

<p>“That’s good.” Mills applied the blotter to the last
signature and rang for the stenographer. When the
young woman had taken the letters away Mills filled
in the assignment on the back of the certificate of stock
in the Rogers Company which Carroll had brought him
that morning and pushed it across the desk.</p>

<p>“You seem to have sold your two hundred shares
in the Rogers Trust, Shep—the two hundred you got
from your mother’s estate.”</p>

<p>“Why, yes, Father,” Shepherd stammered, staring at
the certificate. There was no evidence of irritation in
his father’s face; one might have thought that Mills was
mildly amused by something.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>“You had a perfect right to dispose of it, of course.
I’m just a trifle curious to know why you didn’t mention
it to me. It seemed just a little—a little—unfriendly,
that’s all.”</p>

<p>“No, Father; it wasn’t that!” Shepherd replied
hastily.</p>

<p>It had not occurred to him that his father would
discover the sale so soon. While he hadn’t in so many
words asked Gurley to consider the transaction a confidential
matter, he thought he had conveyed that idea
to the broker. He felt the perspiration creeping out
on his face; his hands trembled so that he hid them in
his pockets. Mills, his arms on the desk, was playing
with a glass paper weight.</p>

<p>“How much did Gurley give you for it?” he asked.</p>

<p>“I sold it at two seventy-five,” Shepherd answered.
The air of the room seemed weighted with impending
disaster. An inexorable fate had set a problem for
him to solve, and his answers, he knew, exposed his
stupidity. It was like a nightmare in which he saw
himself caught in a trap without hope of escape.</p>

<p>“It’s worth five hundred,” said Mills with gentle indulgence.
“But Gurley, in taking advantage of you,
blundered badly. I bought it from him at three eighteen.
And just to show you that I’m a good sport”—Mills
smiled as he reflected that he had never before
applied the phrase to himself—“I’m going to sell it
back to you at the price Gurley paid you. And here’s
a blank check,—we can close the matter right now.”</p>

<p>Mills pretended to be looking over some papers while
Shepherd wrote the check, his fingers with difficulty
moving the pen. A crisis was at hand; or was it a
crisis? His fear of his father, his superstitious awe
of Franklin Mills’s supernatural prescience numbed his
will. The desk seemed to mark a wide gulf between<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>
them. He had frequently rehearsed, since his talk with
Constance, the scene in which he would defend the
building of the clubhouse for the battery employees;
but he was unprepared for this discovery of his purpose.
He had meant to seize some opportunity, preferably
when he could drive his father to the battery
plant and show him the foundations of the clubhouse,
for disclosing the fact that he was going ahead, spending
his own money. It hadn’t occurred to him that
Gurley might sell the stock to his father. He had
made a mess of it. He felt himself cowering, weak
and ineffectual, before another of those velvety strokes
with which his father was always able to defeat him.</p>

<p>“You’d better go in early tomorrow and get a new
certificate; they’re closing the transfer books. The
Rogers is merging with the Central States—formal
announcement will be made early in the new year.
The combination will make a powerful company. The
Rogers lately realized very handsomely on some doubtful
securities that had been charged off several years
ago. It was known only on the inside. Gurley thought
he was making a nice turn for himself, but you see
he wasn’t so clever after all!”</p>

<p>Shepherd shrank further into himself. It was he
who was not clever! He hoped to be dismissed like
a presumptuous schoolboy caught in an attempt to
evade the rules. Franklin Mills, putting aside the crystal
weight, had taken up the ivory paper knife and was
drawing it slowly through his shapely, well-kept hands.</p>

<p>“I suppose it’s none of my business, Shep, but just
why did you sell that stock? It was absolutely safe;
and I thought that as it came to you from your mother,
and her father had been one of the original incorporators,
you would have some sentiment about keeping
it. You’re not embarrassed in any way, are you?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
If you’re not able to live within your income you ought
to come to me about it. You can hardly say that I
haven’t always stood ready to help when you ran
short.”</p>

<p>“Well, no, Father; it wasn’t that. The fact is—well,
to tell the truth——”</p>

<p>Mills was always annoyed by Shepherd’s stammering.
He considered it a sign of weakness in his son;
something akin to a physical blemish. Shepherd
frowned and with a jerk of the head began again determinedly,
speaking slowly.</p>

<p>“I wanted to build that clubhouse for the factory
people. I felt that they deserved it. You refused to
help; I couldn’t make you understand how I felt about
it. I meant to build it myself—pay for it with my own
money. So I sold my Rogers stock. I thought after
I got the thing started you wouldn’t object. You
see——”</p>

<p>Shepherd’s eyes had met his father’s gaze, bent upon
him coldly, and he ceased abruptly.</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s why you sold! My dear boy, I’m surprised
and not a little grieved that you should think of
doing a thing like that. It’s not—not quite——”</p>

<p>“Not quite straight!” Shepherd flung the words at
him, a gleam of defiance in his eyes. “Well, all right!
We’ll say it wasn’t square. But I did it! And you’ve
beaten me. You’ve shown me I’m a fool. I suppose
that’s what I am. I don’t see things as you do; I
wanted to help those people—give them a little cheer—brighten
their lives—make them more contented! But
you couldn’t see that! You don’t care for what I
think; you treat me as though I were a stupid child.
I’m only a figurehead at the plant. When you ask me
questions about the business you do it just to check me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>
up—you’ve already got the answers from Fields. Oh,
I know it! I know what a failure I am!”</p>

<p>He had never before spoken so to his father.
Amazed that he had gotten through with it, he was
horror struck. He sank back in his chair, waiting for
the sharp reprimand, the violent retort he had invited.
It would have been a relief if his father had broken
out in a violent tirade. But Mills had never been
more provokingly calm.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry, Shep, that you have this bitterness in
your heart.” Mills’s tone was that of a man who has
heard forbearingly an unjust accusation and proceeds
patiently to justify himself. “I wouldn’t have you
think I don’t appreciate your feeling about labor; that’s
fine. But I thought you accepted my reasons for refusing.
I’ve studied these things for years. I believe
in dealing justly with labor, but we’ve got to be careful
about mixing business and philanthropy. If you’ll
just think it over you’ll see that for yourself. We’ve
got to be sensible. I’m old-fashioned, I suppose, in my
way of thinking, but——”</p>

<p>His deprecatory gesture was an appeal to his son to
be merciful to a sire so hopelessly benighted. Shepherd
had hardly taken in what his father said. Once
more it was borne in upon him that he was no match
for his father. His anger had fallen upon Franklin
Mills as impotently as a spent wave breaking upon a
stone wall.</p>

<p>“Well, I guess that’s all,” he said faintly.</p>

<p>“One thing more, Shep. There’s another matter I
want to speak of. It’s occurred to me the past year
that you are not happy at the battery plant. Frankly,
I don’t believe you’re quite adapted to an industrial
career. The fact is you’re just a little too sensitive,
too impressionable to deal with labor.” Mills smiled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>
to neutralize any sting that might lurk in the remark.
“I think you’d be happier somewhere else. Now I
want someone to represent me in the trust company
after the merger goes into effect. Carroll is to be the
vice-president and counsel, perhaps ultimately the president.
Fleming did much to build up the Rogers and
he will continue at the head of the merged companies
for the present. But he’s getting on in years and is
anxious to retire. Eventually you and Carroll will
run the thing. I never meant for you to stay in the
battery plant—that was just for the experience. Fields
will take your place out there. It’s fitting that you
should be identified with the trust company. I’ve arranged
to have you elected a vice-president when we
complete the reorganization next month—a fine opportunity
for you, Shep. I hope this meets with your
approval.”</p>

<p>Shepherd nodded a bewildered, grudging assent.
This was the most unexpected of blows. In spite of
the fact that his authority at the battery plant was,
except as to minor routine matters, subordinate to that
of Fields, he enjoyed his work. He had made many
friends among the employees and found happiness in
counseling and helping them in their troubles. He
would miss them. To go into a trust company would
mean beginning a new apprenticeship in a field that in
no way attracted him. He felt humiliated by the incidental
manner of his dismissal from one place and appointment
to another.</p>

<p>His father went on placidly, speaking of the bright
prospects of the trust company, which would be the
strongest institution of the kind in the State. There
were many details to be arranged, but the enlargement
of the Rogers offices to accommodate the combined
companies was already begun, and Shepherd was to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>
ready to make the change on the first of February.
Before he quite realized it his father had glided away
from the subject and was speaking of social matters—inquiring
about a reception someone was giving the
next night. Shepherd picked up his hat and stared at
it as though not sure that it belonged to him. His
father walked round the desk and put out his hand.</p>

<p>“You know, Shep, there’s nothing I have so much
at heart as the welfare of my children. You married
the girl you wanted; I’ve given you this experience
in the battery company, which will be of value to you
in your new position, and now I’m sure you’ll realize
my best hopes for you in what I believe to be a more
suitable line of work. I want you always to remember
it of me that I put the happiness of my children
before every other consideration.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Father.”</p>

<p>Shepherd passed out slowly through the door that
opened directly into the hall and, still dazed, reached
the street. He wandered about, trying to remember
where he had parked his car. The city in which he
was born had suddenly become strange to him. He
dreaded going home and confessing to Constance that
once more he had been vanquished by his father. Constance
would make her usual effort to cheer him, laugh
a little at the ease with which his father had frustrated
him; tell him not to mind. But her very good humor
would be galling. He knew what she would think of
him. He must have time to think before facing Constance.
If he went to the club it would be to look in
upon men intent upon their rhum or bridge, who would
give him their usual abstracted greeting. They cared
nothing for him: he was only the son of a wealthy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>
father who put him into jobs where he would do the
least harm!</p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>He must talk to someone. His heart hungered
for sympathy and kindness. If his father would only
treat him as he would treat any other man; not as a
weakling, a bothersome encumbrance! There was
cruelty in the reflection that, envied as no doubt he
was as the prospective heir to a fortune and the inheritor
of an honored name, there was no friend to
whom he could turn in his unhappiness. He passed
Doctor Lindley, who was talking animatedly to two
men on a corner. A man of God, a priest charged with
the care of souls; but Shepherd felt no impulse to lay
his troubles before the rector of St. Barnabas, much
as he liked him. Lindley would probably rebuke him
for rebelling against his father’s judgments. But
there must be someone....</p>

<p>His heart leaped as he thought of Bruce Storrs.
The young architect, hardly more than an acquaintance,
had in their meetings impressed him by his good
sense and manliness. He would see Storrs.</p>

<p>The elevator shot him up to Freeman’s office. Bruce,
preparing to leave for the day, put out his hand cordially.</p>

<p>“Mr. Freeman’s gone; but won’t you sit and smoke?”</p>

<p>“No, thanks. Happened to be passing and thought
I’d look in. Maybe you’ll join me in a little dash into
the country. This has been an off day with me—everything
messy. I suppose you’re never troubled
that way?”</p>

<p>Bruce saw that something was amiss. Shepherd’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>
attempt to give an air of inadvertence to his call was
badly simulated.</p>

<p>“That’s odd!” Bruce exclaimed. “I’m a little on
edge myself! Just thinking of walking a few miles
to pull myself together. What region shall we favor
with our gloomy presences?”</p>

<p>“That is a question!” Shepherd ejaculated with a
mirthless laugh; and then striking his hands together
as he recalled where he had parked his car, he added:
“Let’s drive to the river and do our walking out there.
You won’t mind—sure I’m not making myself a nuisance?”</p>

<p>“Positive!” Bruce declared, though he smothered
with some difficulty a wish that Shepherd Mills would
keep away from him.</p>

<p>It was inconceivable that Shepherd had been drinking,
but he was clearly laboring under some strong
emotional excitement. In offering his cigarette case
as they waited for the elevator, his hand shook. Bruce
adopted a chaffing tone as they reached the street,
making light of the desperate situation in which they
found themselves.</p>

<p>“We’re two nice birds! All tuckered out by a few
hours’ work. That’s what the indoor life brings us to.
Henderson got off a good one about the new traffic
rules—said they’ve got it fixed now so you can’t turn
anywhere in this town till you get to the cemetery.
Suppose the ancient Egyptians had a lot of trouble
with their chariots—speed devils even in those days!”</p>

<p>Shepherd laughed a little wildly now and then at
Bruce’s efforts at humor. But he said nothing. He
drove the car with what for him was reckless speed.
Bruce good-naturedly chided him, inquiring how he
got his drag with the police department; but he was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>
trying to adjust himself to a Shepherd Mills he hadn’t
known before....</p>

<p>They crossed a bridge and Shepherd stopped the
car at the roadside. “Let’s walk,” he said tensely.
“I’ve got to talk—I’ve <i>got</i> to talk.”</p>

<p>“All right, we’ll walk and talk!” Bruce agreed in
the tone of one indulging a child’s whims.</p>

<p>“I wanted to come to the river,” Shepherd muttered.
“I like being where there’s water.”</p>

<p>“Many people don’t!” Bruce said, thinking his companion
was joking.</p>

<p>“A river is kind; a river is friendly,” Shepherd
added in the curious stifled voice of one who is thinking
aloud. “Water always soothes me—quiets my
nerves”—he threw his hand out. “It seems so free!”</p>

<p>It was now dark and the winter stars shone brightly
over the half-frozen stream. Bruce remembered that
somewhere in the neighborhood he had made his last
stop before entering the city; overcome his last doubt
and burned his mother’s letters that he had borne on
his year-long pilgrimage. And he was here again by
the river with the son of Franklin Mills!</p>

<p>Intent upon his own thoughts, he was hardly conscious
that Shepherd had begun to speak, with a curious
dogged eagerness, in a high strained voice that
broke now and then in a sob. It was of his father
that Shepherd was speaking—of Franklin Mills. He
was a disappointment to his father; there was no sympathy
between them. He had never wanted to go into
business but had yielded in good spirit when his father
opposed his studying medicine. At the battery plant
he performed duties of no significance; the only joy
he derived from the connection was in the friendship
of the employees, and he was now to be disciplined
for wanting to help them. His transfer to the trust<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>
company was only a punishment; in the new position
he would merely repeat his experience in the factory—find
himself of less importance than the office boy.</p>

<p>They paced back and forth at the roadside, hardly
aware of occasional fast-flying cars whose headlights
fell upon them for a moment and left them
again to the stars. When the first passion of his bitter
indignation had spent itself, Shepherd admitted
his father’s generosity. There was no question of
money; his father wished him to live as became the
family dignity. Constance was fine; she was the finest
woman alive, he declared with a quaver in his voice.
But she too had her grievances; his father was never
fair to Constance. Here Shepherd caught himself up
sharply. It was the widening breach between himself
and his father that tore his heart, and Constance had
no part in that.</p>

<p>“I’m stupid; I don’t catch things quickly,” he went
on wearily. “But I’ve tried to learn; I’ve done my best
to please father. But it’s no good! I give it up!”</p>

<p>Bruce, astounded and dismayed by this long recital,
was debating what counsel he could offer. He could
not abandon Shepherd Mills in his dark hour. The
boy—he seemed only that tonight, a miserable, tragic
boy—had opened his heart with a child’s frankness.
Bruce, remembering his own unhappy hours, resolved
to help Shepherd Mills if he could.</p>

<p>Their stay by the river must not be prolonged;
Shepherd was shivering with cold. Bruce had never
before been so conscious of his own physical strength.
He wished that he might confer it upon Shepherd—add
to his stature, broaden the narrow shoulders that
were so unequal to heavy burdens! It was, he felt, a
critical hour in Shepherd Mills’s life; the wrong word
might precipitate a complete break in his relations with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
his father. Franklin Mills, as Bruce’s imagination
quickened under the mystical spell of the night, loomed
beside them—a shadowy figure, keeping step with them
on the dim bank where the wind mourned like an unhappy
spirit through the sycamores.</p>

<p>“I had no right to bother you; you must think me
a fool,” Shepherd concluded. “But it’s helped me, just
to talk. I don’t know why I thought you wouldn’t
mind——”</p>

<p>“Of course I don’t mind!” Bruce replied, and laid
his hand lightly on Shepherd’s shoulder. “I’m pleased
that you thought of me; I want to help. Now, old
man, we’re going to pull you right out of this! It’s
disagreeable to fumble the ball as we all do occasionally.
But this isn’t so terrible! That was a fine idea
of yours to build a clubhouse for the workmen: but
on the other hand there’s something to be said for your
father’s reasons against it. And frankly, I think you
made a mistake in selling your stock without speaking
to him first. It wasn’t quite playing the game.”</p>

<p>“Yes; I can see that,” Shepherd assented faintly.
“But you see I’d got my mind on it; and I wanted to
make things happier for those people.”</p>

<p>“Of course you did! And it’s too bad your father
doesn’t feel about it as you do. But he doesn’t; and
it’s one of the hardest things we have to learn in this
world, that we’ve got to accommodate ourselves very
often to other people’s ideas. That’s life, old man!”</p>

<p>“I suppose you’re right; but I do nothing but blunder.
I never put anything over.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, you do! You said a bit ago your father
didn’t want you to marry the girl you were in love
with; but you did! That scored for you. And about
the clubhouse, it’s hard to give it up; but we passionate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>
idealists have got to learn to wait! Your day will
come to do a lot for humanity.”</p>

<p>“No! I’m done! I’m going away; I want a chance
to live my own life. It’s hell, I tell you, never to be
free; to be pushed into subordinate jobs I hate. By
God, I won’t go into the trust company!”</p>

<p>The oath, probably the first he had ever uttered, cut
sharply into the night. To Bruce it hinted of unsuspected
depths of passion in Shepherd’s nature. The
sense of his own responsibility deepened.</p>

<p>Shepherd, surprised and ashamed of his outburst,
sought and clutched Bruce’s hand.</p>

<p>“Steady, boy!” said Bruce gently. “You’ll <i>take</i> the
job and you’ll go into it with all the pep you can muster!
It offers you a bigger chance than the thing
you’ve been doing. All kinds of people carry their
troubles to a trust company. Such institutions have a
big benevolent side,—look after widows and orphans
and all that sort of thing. If you want to serve
humanity you couldn’t put yourself in a better place!
I’m serious about that. And with Carroll there you’ll
be treated with respect; you can raise the devil if
anybody tries any foolishness! Why, your father’s
promoting you—showing his confidence in a pretty
fine way. He might better have told you of his plans
earlier—I grant that—but he probably thought he’d
save it for a surprise. It was pretty decent of him to
sell you back your stock. A mean, grasping man would
have kept it and swiped the profit. You’ve got to give
him credit for trying to do the square thing by you.”</p>

<p>“It was a slap in the face; he meant to humiliate
me!” cried Shepherd stubbornly.</p>

<p>“All right; assume he did! But don’t be humiliated!”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>“You’d stand for it? You wouldn’t make a row?”
demanded Shepherd quaveringly.</p>

<p>“No: decidedly no!”</p>

<p>“Well, I guess you’re right,” Shepherd replied after
a moment’s silence. “It doesn’t seem so bad the way
you put it. I’m sorry I’ve kept you so long. I’ll
never forget this; you’ve been mighty kind.”</p>

<p>“I think I’ve been right,” said Bruce soberly.</p>

<p>He was thinking of Franklin Mills—his father and
Shepherd’s. There was something grotesque in the
idea that he was acting as a conciliator between Franklin
Mills and this son who had so little of the Mills
iron in his blood. The long story had given him still
another impression of Mills. It was despicable, his
trampling of Shepherd’s toys, his calm destruction of
the boy’s dreams. But even so, Bruce felt that his
advice had been sound. A complete break with his
father would leave Shepherd helpless; and public
opinion would be on the father’s side.</p>

<p>Shepherd struck a match and looked at his watch.</p>

<p>“It’s nearly seven!” he exclaimed. “Connie won’t
know what’s become of me! I think she’s having a
Dramatic Club rehearsal at the house tonight.”</p>

<p>“That’s good. We’ll stop at the first garage and
you can telephone her. Tell her you’re having dinner
with me at the club. And—may I say it?—never tell
her of your bad hour today. That’s better kept to
ourselves.”</p>

<p>“Of course!”</p>

<p>With head erect Shepherd walked to the car. His
self-confidence was returning. Before they reached
the club his spirits were soaring. He was even eager
to begin his work with the trust company.</p>

<p>After a leisurely dinner he drove Bruce home. When
he said good-night at the entrance to the apartment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>
house he grasped both Bruce’s hands and clung to
them.</p>

<p>“Nothing like this ever really happened to me before,”
he said chokingly. “I’ve found a friend!”</p>

<p>They remained silent for a moment. Then Bruce
looked smilingly into Shepherd’s gentle, grateful eyes
and turned slowly into the house. The roar of Shepherd’s
car as it started rose jubilantly in the quiet
street.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER FIFTEEN</h2>
</div>


<h3>I</h3>

<p>Duty was a large word in Franklin Mills’s lexicon.
It pleased him to think that he met all his obligations
as a parent and a citizen. In his own cogitations he
was well satisfied with his handling of his son Shepherd.
Shepherd had needed just the lesson he had
given him in the matter of the sale of the Rogers Trust
Company stock. Mills, not knowing that Bruce Storrs
was responsible for Shepherd’s change of mind, was
highly pleased that his son had expressed his entire
satisfaction with his transfer from the battery plant to
the new trust company.</p>

<p>The fact that Shepherd was now eager to begin his
new work and evidently had forgotten all about the
community house project increased Mills’s contentment
with his own wisdom and his confidence in his ability
to make things happen as he wanted them to happen.
Shepherd was not so weak; he was merely foolish, and
being foolish, it was lucky that he had a father capable
of checking his silly tendencies. The world would
soon be in a pretty mess if all the sons of rich men
were to begin throwing their money to the birds. In
the trust company Shepherd would learn to think in
terms of money without the emotional disturbances<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>
caused by contact with the hands that produced it.
Shepherd, Mills felt, would be all right now. Incidentally
he had taught the young man not to attempt
to play tricks on him—something which no one had
ever tried with success.</p>

<p>The social promotion of the Hardens was proceeding
smoothly, thanks to Connie’s cooperation. Mrs.
Harden had been elected a member of the Orphan
Asylum board, which in itself conferred a certain dignity.
Leila and Connie had effected Millicent’s election
to the Dramatic Club. These matters were accomplished
without friction, as Mills liked to have things
done. Someone discovered that Doctor Harden’s great-grandfather,
back in the year of the big wind, had
collected more bounties for wolf scalps than had ever
been earned by any other settler in Jackson County,
and the Doctor was thereupon admitted to fellowship
in the Pioneer Society. The Hardens did not climb;
they were pushed up the ladder, seemingly by unseen
hands, somewhat to their own surprise and a little to
their discomfiture.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>The only cloud on Mills’s horizon was his apprehension
as to Leila’s future. Mills was increasingly
aware that she couldn’t be managed as he managed
Shepherd. He had gone as far as he dared in letting
Carroll know that he would be an acceptable son-in-law,
and he had perhaps intimated a little too plainly
to Leila the desirability of such an arrangement. Carroll
visited the house frequently; but Leila snubbed him
outrageously. When it pleased her to accept his attentions
it was merely, Mills surmised, to allay suspicion
as to her interest elsewhere. It was his duty to see<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>
that Leila married in keeping with her status as the
daughter of the house of Mills.</p>

<p>In analyzing his duty with respect to Leila, it occurred
to Mills that he might have been culpable in
not laying more stress upon the merits of religion in
the upbringing of Leila. She had gone to Sunday
school in her earliest youth; but churchgoing was not
to her taste. He was unable to remember when Leila
had last attended church, but never voluntarily within
his recollection. She needed, he decided, the sobering
influence of religion. God, in Mills’s speculations, was
on the side of order, law and respectability. The
church frowned upon divorce; and Leila must be saved
from the disgrace of marrying a divorced man. Leila
needed religion, and the idea broadened in Mills’s mind
until he saw that probably Constance and Shepherd,
too, would be safer under the protecting arm of the
church.</p>

<p>The Sunday following Christmas seemed to Mills
a fitting time for renewing the family’s acquaintance
with St. Barnabas. When he telephoned his invitation
to Constance, carefully putting it in the form of a suggestion,
he found his daughter-in-law wholly agreeable
to the idea. She and Shepherd would be glad to
breakfast with him and accompany him to divine worship.
When he broached the matter to Leila she did
not explode as he had expected. She took a cigarette
from her mouth and expelled the smoke from her
lungs.</p>

<p>“Sure, I’ll go with you, Dada,” she replied.</p>

<p>He had suggested nine as a conservative breakfast
hour, but Constance and Shepherd were fifteen minutes
late. Leila was considerably later, but appeared finally,
after the maid had twice been dispatched to her room.
Having danced late, she was still sleepy. At the table<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>
she insisted on scanning the society page of the morning
newspaper. This annoyed Mills, particularly when
in spreading out the sheet she upset her water glass,
with resulting deplorable irrigation of the tablecloth
and a splash upon Connie’s smart morning dress that
might or might not prove permanently disfiguring.
Mills hated a messy table. He also hated criticism of
food. Leila’s complaint that the scalloped sweetbreads
were too dry evoked the pertinent retort that if she
hadn’t been late they wouldn’t have been spoiled.</p>

<p>“I guess that’ll hold me for a little while,” she said
cheerfully. “I say, Dada, what do we get for going to
church?”</p>

<p>“You’ll get what you need from Doctor Lindley,”
Mills replied, frowning at the butler, who was stupidly
oblivious of the fact that the flame under the percolator
was threatening a general conflagration. Shepherd,
in trying to clap on the extinguisher, burned his
fingers and emitted a shrill cry of pain. All things
considered, the breakfast was hardly conducive to
spiritual uplift.</p>

<p>It was ten minutes after eleven when the Millses
reached St. Barnabas and the party went down the
aisle pursued by an usher to the chanting of the
<i>Venite, exultemus Domino</i>. The usher, caught off
guard, was guiltily conscious of having a few minutes
before filled the Mills pew with strangers in accordance
with the rule that reserved seats for their owners
only until the processional. Mills, his silk hat on his
arm, had not foreseen such a predicament. He paused
in perplexity beside the ancestral pew in which five
strangers were devoutly reinforcing the chanting of
the choir, happily unaware that they were trespassers
upon the property of Franklin Mills.</p>

<p>The courteous usher lifted his hand to indicate his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>
mastery of the situation and guided the Mills party in
front of the chancel to seats in the south transept. This
maneuver had the effect of publishing to the congregation
the fact that Franklin Mills, his son, daughter-in-law
and daughter, were today breaking an abstinence
from divine worship which regular attendants knew to
have been prolonged.</p>

<p>Constance, Leila and Shepherd knelt at once; Mills
remained standing. A lady behind him thrust a prayer
book into his hand. In trying to find his glasses he
dropped the book, which Leila, much diverted, recovered
as she rose. This was annoying and added to
Mills’s discomfiture at being planted in the front seat
of the transept where the whole congregation could
observe him at leisure.</p>

<p>However, by the time the proper psalms for the
day had been read he had recovered his composure
and listened attentively to Doctor Lindley’s sonorous
reading of the lessons. His seat enabled him to contemplate
the Mills memorial window in the north
transept, a fact which mitigated his discomfort at
being deprived of the Mills pew.</p>

<p>Leila stifled a yawn as the rector introduced as the
preacher for the day a missionary bishop who had
spent many years in the Orient. Mills had always been
impatient of missionary work among peoples who, as
he viewed the matter, were entitled to live their lives
and worship their gods without interference by meddlesome
foreigners. But the discourse appealed strongly
to his practical sense. He saw in the schools and hospitals
established by the church in China a splendid
advertisement of American good will and enterprise.
Such philanthropies were calculated to broaden the
market for American trade. When Doctor Lindley
announced that the offerings for the day would go to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>
the visitor to assist in the building of a new hospital
in his far-away diocese, Mills found a hundred dollar
bill to lay on the plate....</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>As they drove to Shepherd’s for dinner he good-naturedly
combated Constance’s assertion that Confucius
was as great a teacher as Christ. Leila said
she’d like to adopt a Chinese baby; the Chinese babies
in the movies were always so cute. Shepherd’s philanthropic
nature had been deeply impressed by the idea
of reducing human suffering through foreign missions.
He announced that he would send the bishop a check.</p>

<p>“Well, I claim it was a good sermon,” said Leila.
“That funny old bird talked a hundred berries out of
Dada.”</p>

<p>When they reached the table, Mills reproved Leila
for asserting that she guessed she was a Buddhist. She
confessed under direct examination that she knew nothing
about Buddhism but thought it might be worth
taking up sometime.</p>

<p>“Millie says there’s nothing in the Bible so wonderful
as the world itself,” Leila continued. “Millie has
marvelous ideas. Talk about miracles—she says the
grass and the sunrise are miracles.”</p>

<p>“Millie is such a dear,” Constance murmured in a
tone that implied a lack of enthusiasm for grass and
sunrises.</p>

<p>“Millicent has a poetic nature,” Mills remarked,
finding himself self-conscious at the mention of Millicent.
Millicent’s belief in a Supreme Power that controls
the circling planets and guides the destinies of
man was interesting because Millicent held it and talked
of it charmingly.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>“<i>Did</i> you see that outlandish hat Mrs. Charlie Felton
was sporting?” Leila demanded with cheerful
irrelevance. “I’ll say it’s some hat! She ought to hire
a blind woman to buy her clothes.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t see anything the matter with her hat,” remarked
Shepherd.</p>

<p>“You <i>wouldn’t</i>, dear!” said Constance.</p>

<p>“Who’s Charlie Felton?” asked Mills. “It seemed
to me I didn’t know a dozen people in church this
morning.”</p>

<p>“Oh, the Feltons have lately moved here from Racine,
Fond du Lac or St. Louis—one of those queer
Illinois towns.”</p>

<p>“Those towns may be queer,” said her father gently.
“But they are not in Illinois.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, give them to Kansas, then,” said Leila,
who was never disturbed by her errors in geography
or any other department of knowledge. “You know,”
she continued, glad the conversation had been successfully
diverted from religion, “that Freddy Thomas
was in college with Charlie Felton and Freddy says
Mrs. Felton isn’t as bad as her hats.”</p>

<p>Mills frowned. Shepherd laughed at this more joyously
than the remark deserved and stammeringly tried
to cover up the allusion to Thomas. It was sheer impudence
for Leila to introduce into the Sunday table talk
a name that could only irritate her father; but before
Shepherd could make himself articulate Mills looked
up from his salad.</p>

<p>“<i>Freddy?</i> I didn’t know you were so intimate with
anyone of that name.”</p>

<p>This was not, of course, strictly true. Leila always
referred to Thomas as Freddy; she found a mischievous
delight in doing so before her father. Since she
became aware of her father’s increasing displeasure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>
at Thomas’s attentions and knew that the young man’s
visits at the house were a source of irritation, she had
been meeting Thomas at the homes of one or another
of her friends whose discretion could be relied on,
or at the public library or the Art Institute—it was a
joke that Leila should have availed herself of these
institutions for any purpose! Constance in giving her
an admonitory prod under the table inadvertently
brushed her father-in-law’s shin.</p>

<p>“I meant Mr. Frederick Thomas, Dada,” Leila replied,
her gentle tone in itself a species of impudence.</p>

<p>“I hope you are about done with that fellow,” said
Mills, frowning.</p>

<p>“Sure, Dada, I’m about through with him,” she replied
with intentional equivocation.</p>

<p>“I should think you would be! I don’t like the idea
of your name being associated with his!”</p>

<p>“Well, it isn’t, is it?”</p>

<p>Mills disliked being talked back to. His annoyance
was increased by the fact that he had been unable to
learn anything detrimental to Thomas beyond the fact
that the man had been divorced. The decree of divorce,
he had learned in Chicago, was granted to Thomas
though his wife had brought the suit. While not
rich, Thomas was well-to-do, and when it came to
the question of age, Arthur Carroll was a trifle older.
But Leila should marry Carroll. Carroll was ideally
qualified to enter the family by reason of his familiarity
with its history and traditional conservatism. He
knew and respected the Franklin Mills habit of mind,
and this in itself was an asset. Mills had no intention
of being thwarted in his purpose to possess Carroll as
a son-in-law....</p>

<p>Gloom settled over the table. Mills, deeply preoccupied,
ate his dessert in silence. Leila presented a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>
much more serious and pressing problem than foreign
missions. Constance strove vainly to dispel the cloud.
Leila alone seemed untroubled; she repeated a story
that Bud Henderson had told her which was hardly
an appropriate addendum for a missionary sermon.
Her father rebuked her sternly. If there was anything
that roused his ire it was a risqué story.</p>

<p>“One might think,” he said severely, “that you were
brought up in a slum from the way you talk. The
heathen are not all in China!”</p>

<p>“Well, it is a funny story,” Leila persisted. “I told
it to Doctor Harden and he almost died laffin’. Doc
certainly knows a joke. You’re not angry—not really,
terribly angry at your ’ittle baby girl, is ’ou, Dada?”</p>

<p>“I most certainly am!” he retorted grimly. A moment
later he added: “Well, let’s go to Deer Trail for
supper. Connie, you and Shep are free for the evening,
I hope?”</p>

<p>“We’ll be glad to go, of course,” Constance replied
amiably.</p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>The Sunday evening suppers at Deer Trail were
usually discontinued after Christmas, and Leila was
taken aback by the announcement. Her father had not,
she noted, shown his usual courtesy in asking her if
she cared to go. She correctly surmised that the proposed
flight into the country was intended as a disciplinary
measure for her benefit. She had promised
to meet Thomas at the Burtons’ at eight o’clock, and
he could hardly have hit upon anything better calculated
to awaken resentment in her young breast. She
began to consider the hazards of attempting to communicate
with Thomas to explain her inability to keep<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>
the appointment. As there were to be no guests, the
evening at Deer Trail promised to be an insufferably
dull experience and she must dodge it if possible.</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t let’s do that!” she said. “It’s too cold,
Dada. And the house is always drafty in the winter!”</p>

<p>“Drafty!” Her father stared at her blandly. The
country house was steam-heated and this was the first
time he had ever heard that it was drafty. The suggestion
of drafts was altogether unfortunate. “Had
you any engagement for this evening?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Oh, I promised Mrs. Torrence I’d go there for supper—she’s
having some people in to do some music.
It’s just an informal company, but I hate dropping out.”</p>

<p>Constance perceptibly shuddered.</p>

<p>“When did she give this invitation?” asked Mills,
with the utmost urbanity.</p>

<p>“Oh, I met her downtown yesterday. It’s no great
matter, Dada. If you’re making a point of it, I’ll
be glad to go to the farm!”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Torrence must be a quick traveler,” her father
replied, entirely at ease. “I met her myself yesterday
morning. She was just leaving for Louisville and
didn’t expect to be back until Tuesday.”</p>

<p>“How funny!” Leila ejaculated, though she had little
confidence in her ability to give a humorous aspect to
her plight. She bent her head in the laugh of self-derision
which she had frequently employed in easing
her way out of similar predicaments with her father.
This time it merely provoked an ironic smile.</p>

<p>Mills, from the extension telephone in the living
room, called Deer Trail to give warning of the approach
of four guests for supper; there was no possible escape
from this excursion. Thomas filled Leila’s thoughts.
He had been insisting that they be married before the
projected trip to Bermuda. The time was short and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>
she was uncertain whether to take the step now or
postpone it in the hope of winning her father’s consent
in the intimate association of their travels.</p>

<p>Today Mills’s cigar seemed to be of interminable
length. As he smoked he talked in the leisurely fashion
he enjoyed after a satisfactory meal, and Constance
never made the mistake of giving him poor food. He
had caught Leila in a lie—a stupid, foolish lie; but
no one would have guessed that it had impressed him
disagreeably or opened a new train of suspicions in
his mind. Constance was admiring his perfect self-restraint;
Franklin Mills, no matter what else he might
or might not be, was a thoroughbred.</p>

<p>“If you don’t have to stop at home, Leila, we can
start from here,” he said—“at three o’clock.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Dada. I’m all set!” she replied.</p>

<p>Constance and Shepherd left the room and Leila was
prepared for a sharp reprimand, but her father merely
asked whether she had everything necessary for the
Bermuda trip. He had his steamer reservation and
they would go to New York a few days ahead of the
sailing date to see the new plays and she could pick up
any little things she needed.</p>

<p>“Arthur’s going East at the same time. We have
some business errands in New York,” he continued in
a matter of course tone.</p>

<p>She was aware that he had mentioned Carroll with
special intention, and it added nothing to her peace of
mind.</p>

<p>“That’s fine, Dada,” she said, reaching for a fresh
cigarette. “Arthur can take me to some of the new
dancing places. Arthur’s a good little hopper.”</p>

<p>She felt moved to try to gloss over her blunder in
pretending to have an engagement that evening with
Helen Torrence, but her intuitions warned her that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>
time was not fortunate for the practice of her familiar
cajoleries upon her father. She realized that she had
outgrown her knack of laughing herself out of her
troubles; and she had never before been trapped so
neatly. Like Shepherd, she felt that in dealing with
her father she never knew what was in his mind until
he laid his cards on the table—laid them down with the
serenity of one who knows thoroughly the value of his
hand.</p>

<p>She was deeply in love with Thomas and craved
sympathy and help; but she felt quite as Shepherd
always did, her father’s remoteness and the closing of
the common avenues of communication between human
beings. He had always indulged her, shown kindness
even when he scolded and protested against her conduct;
but she felt that his heart was as inaccessible as a safety
box behind massive steel doors. On the drive to Deer
Trail she took little part in the talk, to which Shepherd
and Constance tried, with indifferent success, to impart
a light and cheery tone. When they reached the country
house, which derived a fresh picturesqueness from
the snowy fields about it, Mills left them, driving on to
the stables for a look at his horses.</p>

<p>“Well, that was some break!” exclaimed Constance
the moment they were within doors. “Everybody in
town knows Helen is away. You ought to have known
it yourself! I never knew you to do anything so clumsy
as that!”</p>

<p>“Oh, shoot! I didn’t want to come out here today.
It’s a bore; nobody here and nothing to do. And I
object to being punished like a child!”</p>

<p>“You needn’t have lied to your father; that was
inexcusable,” said Constance. “If you’ve got to do
such a thing, please don’t do it when I’m around!”</p>

<p>“See here, sis,” began Shepherd with a prolonged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>
sibilant stutter, “let’s be frank about this! You know
this thing of meeting Fred Thomas at other people’s
houses is no good. You’ve got to stop it! Father
would be terribly cut up if he found you out. You
may be sure he suspects something now, after that
foolish break about going to Helen Torrence’s.”</p>

<p>“Well, I haven’t said I was going to meet anyone,
have I?” Leila demanded defiantly.</p>

<p>“You don’t have to. There are other people just
as clever as you are,” Constance retorted, jerking off
her gloves.</p>

<p>“I can’t imagine what you see in Thomas,” Shepherd
persisted.</p>

<p>“I don’t care if you don’t. It’s my business what
I see in him.” Leila nervously lighted a cigarette.
“Freddy’s a fine fellow; father doesn’t know a thing
against him!”</p>

<p>“If you marry him you’ll break father’s heart,” Shepherd
declared solemnly.</p>

<p>“His heart!” repeated Leila with fine contempt.
“You needn’t think he’s going to treat me as he treats
you. I won’t stand for it! How about that clubhouse
you wanted to build—how about this sudden idea of
taking you out of the battery business and sticking
you into the trust company? You didn’t want to
change, did you? He didn’t ask you if you wanted to
move, did he? I’ll say he didn’t! That’s dada all
over—he doesn’t ask you; he tells you! And I’m not
a child to be sent to bed whenever his majesty gets
peevish.”</p>

<p>“Don’t be ridiculous!” said Constance with a despairing
sigh. “You’re going to make trouble for all
of us if you don’t drop Freddy!”</p>

<p>“You tell <i>me</i> not to make trouble!”</p>

<p>Leila’s eyes flashed her scorn of the idea and something<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>
more. Her words had the effect of bringing a
deep flush to Constance’s face. Constance walked to
the fire and sat down. There was no counting on
Leila’s discretion; and if she eloped with Thomas the
town would hum with talk about the whole Mills family.</p>

<p>“Now, Leila,” began Shepherd, who had not noticed
his wife’s perturbation or understood the nature of
the spiteful little stab that caused it. “You’d better
try to square yourself with father.”</p>

<p>“I see myself trying! You two make me tired!
Please don’t talk to me any more!”</p>


<h3>V</h3>

<p>She waited until Constance and Shepherd had found
reading matter and were settled before the fireplace,
and then with the remark that she wanted to fix her
hair, went upstairs; and after closing a door noisily
to allay suspicions, went cautiously down the back stairs
to the telephone in the butler’s pantry. Satisfying herself
by a glance through the window that her father
was still at the stables, she called Thomas’s number
and explained her inability to go to the Burtons’ where
they had planned to meet. Happy to hear his voice,
she talked quite as freely as though speaking to him
face to face, and his replies over the wire soothed and
comforted her....</p>

<p>“No, dear; there’d only be a row if you asked father
now. You’ll have to take my word for that, Freddy.”</p>

<p>“I’m not so sure of that—if he knows you love me!”</p>

<p>“Of course I love you, Freddy!”</p>

<p>“Then let us be married and end all this bother.
You’re of age; there’s nothing to prevent us. I’d a
lot rather have it out with your father now. I know I
can convince him that I’m respectable and able to take<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>
care of you. I’ve got the record of the divorce case;
there’s nothing in it I’m ashamed of.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right enough; but the very mention of it
would make him furious. We’ve talked of this a hundred
times, Freddy, and I’m not going to let you make
that mistake. We’re going to wait a little longer!”</p>

<p>“You won’t go back on me?”</p>

<p>“Never, Freddy!”</p>

<p>“You might meet someone on the trip you’d like
better. I’m going to be terribly nervous about you!”</p>

<p>“Then you don’t trust me! If you don’t trust me
you don’t love me!”</p>

<p>“Don’t be so foolish. I’m mad about you. And
I’m sick of all this sneaking round for a chance to see
you!”</p>

<p>“Be sensible, dear; it’s just as hard for me as it is
for you. And people <i>are</i> talking!”</p>

<p>In her absorption she had forgotten the importance
of secrecy and the danger of being overheard. The
swing doors had creaked several times, but she had
attributed this to suction from an open window in the
kitchen. Constance and Shepherd would wonder at
her absence; the talk must not be prolonged.</p>

<p>“I’ve got to go!” she added hurriedly.</p>

<p>“Say you care—that you’re not just putting me
off——”</p>

<p>“I love you, Freddy! Please be patient. Remember,
I love you with all my heart! Yes, always!”</p>

<p>As she hung up the receiver she turned round to
face her father. He had entered the house through
the kitchen and might or might not have heard part of
her dialogue with Thomas. But she was instantly
aware that her last words, in the tense, lover-like tone
in which she had spoken them, were enough to convict
her.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>“Hello, Dada! How’s the live stock?” she asked
with poorly feigned carelessness as she hung the receiver
on the hook.</p>

<p>Mills, his overcoat flung over his arm, his hat pushed
back from his forehead, eyed her with a cold stare.</p>

<p>“Why are you telephoning here?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“No reasons. I didn’t want to disturb Connie and
Shep. They’re reading in the living-room.”</p>

<p>“That’s very thoughtful of you, I’m sure!”</p>

<p>“I thought so myself,” she replied, and took a step
toward the dining-room door. He flung out his arm
arrestingly.</p>

<p>“Just a moment, please!”</p>

<p>“Oh, hours—if you want them!”</p>

<p>“I overheard some of your speeches. To whom
were you speaking—tell me the truth!”</p>

<p>“Don’t be so fierce about it! And do take off your
hat! You look so funny with your hat stuck on the
back of your head that way!”</p>

<p>“Never mind my hat! It will be much better for
you not to trifle with me. Who was on the other end
of that telephone?”</p>

<p>“What if I don’t tell you?” she demanded.</p>

<p>“I want an answer to my question! You told me
one falsehood today; I don’t want to hear another!”</p>

<p>“Well, you won’t! I was talking to Mr. Frederick
V. Thomas!”</p>

<p>“I thought as much. Now I’ve told you as plainly
as I know how that you’ve got to drop that fellow.
He’s a scoundrel to force his attentions on you. I
haven’t wanted to bring matters to an issue with you
about him. I’ve been patient with you—let him come
to the house and go about with you. But you’ve not
played fair with me. When I told you I didn’t like
his coming to the house so much you began meeting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>
him when you thought I wouldn’t know it—that’s a
fact, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Dada—only a few times, though.”</p>

<p>“May I ask what you mean by that? That a girl
brought up as you have been, with every advantage
and indulgence, should be so basely ungrateful as to
meet a man I disapprove of—meet him in ways that
show you know you’re doing a wrong thing—is beyond
my understanding. It’s contemptible; it’s close
upon the unpardonable!”</p>

<p>“Then why don’t you act decently about it?” She
lifted her head and met his gaze unwaveringly. “If
you didn’t hear what I said I’ll tell you! I told him
I love him; I’ve promised to marry him.”</p>

<p>“Well, you won’t marry him!” he exclaimed, his
voice quavering in his effort to restrain his anger. “A
man who’s left a wife somewhere and plays upon the
sympathy of a credulous young girl like you is a contemptible
hound!”</p>

<p>“All right, then! He’s a contemptible hound!”</p>

<p>Her insolence, her refusal to cower before him, increased
his anger. His time-tried formula for meeting
emergencies by superior strategy—the method that
worked so well with his son—was of no use to him
here. He had lost a point in letting her see that for
once in his life his temper had got the better of him.
He had been too tolerant of her faults; the bills for
his indulgence were coming in now—a large sheaf of
them. She must be handled with care—with very great
caution, indeed; thus far in his life he had got what he
wanted, and it was not for a girl whom he saw only as
a spoiled child to circumvent him.</p>

<p>But he realized at this moment that Leila was no
longer a child. She was not only a woman, but a
woman it would be folly to attempt to drive or frighten.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>
He was alarmed by the composure with which she
waited for the further disclosure of his purposes, standing
with her back against the service shelf, eyeing him
half hostilely, half, he feared, with a hope that he
would carry the matter further and open his guard
for a thrust he was not prepared to parry. He was
afraid of her, but she must not know that he was
afraid.</p>

<p>He took off his hat and let it swing at arm’s length
as he considered how to escape with dignity from the
corner into which she had forced him. Sentiment is
a natural refuge of the average man when other resources
fail. He smiled benevolently, and with a quick
lifting of the head remarked:</p>

<p>“This isn’t the way for us to talk to each other.
We’ve always been the best of friends; nothing’s going
to change that. I trust your good sense—I trust”—here
his voice sank under the weight of emotion—“I
trust your love for me—your love for your dear
mother’s memory—to do nothing to grieve me, nothing
that would hurt her.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Dada,” she said absently, not sure how far
she could trust his mood. Then she walked up to him
and drew her hand across his cheek and gave his tie a
twitch. He drew his arm about her and kissed her
forehead.</p>

<p>“Let this be between ourselves,” he said. “I’ll go
around and come in the front way.”</p>

<p>She went up the back stairs and reappeared in the
living-room, whistling. Constance and Shepherd were
still reading before the fire where she had left them.</p>

<p>After supper—served at the dining-room table tonight—Leila
was unwontedly silent, and the attempts
of Constance and Shepherd to be gay were sadly deficient
in spontaneity. Mills’s Sunday, which had begun<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>
with high hopes, had been bitterly disappointing.
Though outwardly tranquil and unbending a little more
than usual, his mind was elsewhere.</p>


<h3>VI</h3>

<p>The happy life manifestly was not to be won merely
by going to church. At the back of his mind, with
all his agnosticism, he had entertained a superstitious
belief that in Christianity there was some secret of
happiness revealed to those who placed themselves receptively
close to the throne of grace. This was evidently
a mistake; or at least it was clear from the day’s
experience that the boon was less easy of attainment
than he had believed.</p>

<p>He recalled what the rector of St. Barnabas had
said to him the morning he had gone in to inspect the
Mills window—that walls do not make the church, that
the true edifice is within man’s own breast. Lindley
shouldn’t say things like that, to perplex the hearer,
baffle him, create a disagreeable uneasiness! This hint
of a God whose tabernacle is in every man’s heart
was displeasing. Mills didn’t like the idea of carrying
God around with him. To grant any such premise
would be to open the way for doubts as to his omnipotence
in his own world; and Franklin Mills was not
ready for that. He groped for a deity who wouldn’t
be a nuisance, like a disagreeable guest in the house,
upsetting the whole establishment! God should be a
convenience, subject to call like a doctor or a lawyer.
But how could a man reach Lindley’s God, who wasn’t
in the church at all, but within man himself?</p>

<p>In his pondering he came back to his own family.
He didn’t know Shepherd; he didn’t know Leila. And<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>
this was all wrong. He knew Millicent Harden better
than he knew either of his children.</p>

<p>He had friends who were good pals with their children,
and he wondered how they managed it. Maybe
it was the spirit of the age that was the trouble. It
was a common habit to fix responsibility for all the
disturbing moral and social phenomena of the time
on the receding World War, or the greed for gain, or
the diminished zeal for religion. This brought him
again to God; uncomfortable—the reflection that
thought in all its circling and tangential excursions
does somehow land at that mysterious door.... Leila
must be dealt with. She was much too facile in dissimulation.
He was confident that no other Mills had
ever been like that.</p>

<p>When they reached home he followed Leila into
her room. He took the cigarette she offered him and
sat down in the low rocking chair she pulled out for
him—a befrilled feminine contrivance little to his
taste. Utterly at a loss as to how he could most effectively
reprimand her for her attempted deception and
give her to understand that he would never countenance
a marriage with Thomas, he was relieved when she
took the initiative.</p>

<p>“I <i>was</i> naughty, Dada!” she said. “But Freddy
was going over to the Burtons’ tonight and I had told
him I’d be there—that’s all. I wasn’t just crazy about
going to the farm.”</p>

<p>She held a match for him, extinguished it with a
flourish, and after lighting her own cigarette dropped
down on the chaise longue with a weary little sigh.
If she had remained standing or had sat down properly
in a chair, his rôle as the stern, aggrieved parent
would have been simpler. Leila was so confoundedly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>
difficult, so completely what he wished she was not!</p>

<p>“About this Thomas——” he began.</p>

<p>“Oh, pshaw! Don’t you bother a little tiny bit
about him. I’m just teasing him along.”</p>

<p>“I must say your talk over the telephone sounded
pretty serious to me!”</p>

<p>“Oh, bunk! All the girls talk to men that way these
days—it doesn’t mean anything!”</p>

<p>“What’s that? You say the words you used don’t
<i>mean</i> anything?”</p>

<p>“Not a thing, Dada. If you’d tell a man you didn’t
love him he’d be sure to think you did!”</p>

<p>“A dangerous idea, I should think.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no! Everything’s different from what it was
when you were young!”</p>

<p>“Yes; I’ve noticed that!” he replied drily. “But
seriously, Leila, this meeting a man—a man we know
little about—at other people’s houses won’t do! You
ought to have more self-respect and dignity than that!”</p>

<p>“You’re making too much of it, Dada! It’s happened
only two or three times. I thought you were
sore about Freddy’s coming here so much, and I <i>have</i>
met him other places—always perfectly proper places!”</p>

<p>“I should hope so!” he exclaimed with his first display
of spirit. “But you can’t afford to go about
with him. You’ve got to remember the community has
a right to expect the best of you. You should think
of your dear mother even if you don’t care for me!”</p>

<p>“Now, Dada!” She leveled her arm at him, the
smoking cigarette in her slim fingers. “Don’t be silly;
you <i>know</i> I adore you; I’ve always been perfectly crazy
about you!”</p>

<p>She spoke in much the same tone she would have
used in approving of a new suit of clothes he had
submitted for inspection.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>“Now, I have your promise——” he said, sitting up
alertly in his chair.</p>

<p>“Promise, Dada?” she inquired, her thoughts far
afield. “Oh, about Freddy! Well, if you’ll be happier
I promise you now never to marry him. Frankly—<i>frankly</i>—I’m
not going to marry anybody right away.
When I get ready I’ll probably marry Arthur if some
widow doesn’t snatch him first. But please don’t crowd
me, Dada! If there <i>is</i> anything I hate it’s being
crowded!”</p>

<p>“Nobody’s crowding you!” he said, feeling that she
was once more eluding him.</p>

<p>“Then don’t push!” she laughed.</p>

<p>“Let’s not have any more nonsense,” he said. “I
think you do a lot of things just to annoy me. It isn’t
fair!”</p>

<p>“Why, Dada!” she exclaimed in mock astonishment.
“I thought you liked being kidded. I kid all your old
friends and it tickles ’em to death.”</p>

<p>“Go to bed!” he retorted, laughing in spite of himself.</p>

<p>She mussed his hair before kissing him good-night,
but even as he turned away he could see that her
thoughts were elsewhere.</p>


<h3>VII</h3>

<p>Behind his own door, as he thought it over, the
interview was about as unsatisfactory as an interview
could be. She had kept it in her own hands, left him
no opening for the eloquent appeal he had planned or
the severe scolding she deserved. He wished he dared
go back and put his arms about her and tell her how
deeply he loved her. But he lacked the courage; she
wouldn’t understand it. It was the cruelest of ironies<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>
that he dare not knock at his child’s door to tell her
how precious she was to him.</p>

<p>That was the trouble—he didn’t know how to make
her understand! As he paced the floor, he wondered
whether anyone in all the world had ever loved him!
Yes, there was Marian Storrs; and, again, the woman
who had been his wife. Beyond question each had, in
her own way, loved him; but both were gathered into
the great company of the dead. That question, as to
whether anyone had ever loved him, reversed itself: in
the whole course of his life had he, Franklin Mills,
ever unselfishly loved anyone? This was the most
disagreeable question that had forced itself upon
Franklin Mills’s attention in a long time. As he tried
to go to sleep it took countless forms in the dark, till
the room danced with interrogation marks.</p>

<p>He turned on the lights and got up. After moving
about restlessly for a time he found himself staring at
his reflection in the panel mirror in the bathroom door.
It seemed to him that the shadow in the glass was not
himself but the phantom of a man he had never known.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER SIXTEEN</h2>
</div>


<h3>I</h3>

<p>At Christmas Bruce had sent Millicent a box of
flowers, which she had acknowledged in a cordial little
note, but he had not called on her, making the excuse
to himself that he lacked time. But the real reason
was a fear that he had begun to care too much for her.
He must not allow himself to love her when he could
never marry her; he could never ask any woman to
take a name to which he had no honest right.</p>

<p>But if he hadn’t seen Millicent he heard of her frequently.
He was established as a welcome visitor at
all times at the Freemans’ and the Hendersons’. The
belated social recognition of the Hardens, in spite of
the adroitness with which Mills had inspired it, had
not gone unremarked.</p>

<p>There was, Bud said, always some reason for everything
Mills did; and Maybelle, who knew everything
that was said and done in town, had remarked in
Bruce’s hearing that the Hardens’ social promotion
was merely an item in Mills’s courtship of Millicent.</p>

<p>“I’ll wager he doesn’t make it! Millicent will never
do it,” was Maybelle’s opinion, expressed one evening
at dinner.</p>

<p>“Why not?” Bruce asked, trying to conceal his suspicion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>
that the remark was made for his own encouragement.</p>

<p>“Oh, Millie’s not going to throw herself away on an
old bird like Frank Mills. She values her youth too
much for that.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you never can tell,” said Bud provokingly.
“Girls have done it before this.”</p>

<p>“But not girls like Millicent!” Maybelle flung back.</p>

<p>“That’s easy,” Bud acquiesced. “There never was
a girl like Millie—not even you, Maybelle, much as I
love you. But all that mazuma and that long line of
noble ancestors; not a spot on the whole bloomin’
scutcheon! I wonder if Mills is really teasing himself
with the idea that he has even a look-in!”</p>

<p>“What you ought to do, Bruce, is to sail in and
marry Millie yourself,” said Maybelle. “Dale and I
are strong for you!”</p>

<p>“Thanks for the compliment!” exclaimed Bruce.
“You and Dale want me to enter the race in the hope
of seeing Mills knocked out! No particular interest
in me! You don’t want me to win half as much as
you want the great Mills to lose. Alas! And this is
friendship!”</p>

<p>“The idea warms my sporting blood,” said Bud.
“Once the struggle begins we’ll post the bets on the
club bulletin. I’ll start with two to one on you, old
top!”</p>

<p>“I’m surprised at Connie—she seems to be helping
on the boosting of the Hardens,” said Maybelle. “It
must occur to her that it wouldn’t help her own fortunes
to have a healthy young stepmother-in-law prance
into the sketch. When Frank Mills passes on some
day Connie’s going to be all set to spend a lot of his
money. Connie’s one of the born spenders.”</p>

<p>“That’s all well enough,” remarked Bud. “But just<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>
now Connie’s only too glad to have Mills’s attention
directed away from her own little diversions. She and
George Whitford——”</p>

<p>“Bud!” Maybelle tapped her water glass sharply.
“Remember, boys, these people are our friends!”</p>

<p>“Not so up-stage, darling!” said Bud. “I’m sure
we’ve been talking only in a spirit of loving kindness!”</p>

<p>“Honorable men and women—one and all!” said
Bruce.</p>

<p>“Absolutely!” Bud affirmed, and the subject was
dropped.</p>

<p>A few nights later Bruce was obliged to listen to
similar talk at the Freemans’, though in a different
key. Mrs. Freeman was indignant that Mills should
think of marrying Millicent.</p>

<p>“There’s just one right man in the world for every
woman,” she declared. “And the right man for Millicent
is you, Bruce Storrs!”</p>

<p>Bruce met her gaze with mock solemnity.</p>

<p>“Please don’t force me into a hasty marriage! Here
I am, a struggling young architect who will soon be
not so young. Give me time to become self-supporting!”</p>

<p>“Of course Millie will marry you in the proper course
of things,” said Freeman. “If that girl should throw
herself away on Franklin Mills she wouldn’t be Millie.
And she is very much Millie!”</p>

<p>“Heavens!” exclaimed his wife. “The bare thought
of that girl, with her beauty, her spiritual insight, her
sweetness, linking herself to that—that——”</p>

<p>“This talk is all bosh!” interrupted Freeman. “I
doubt if Mills ever sees Millicent alone. These gossips
ought to be sent to the penal farm.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I think they’ve seen each other in a neighborly
sort of way,” said Mrs. Freeman. “Mills is a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>
cultivated man and Millicent’s music and modeling no
doubt really interest him. I ran in to see her the other
morning and she’s been doing a bust of Mills—she
laughed when I asked her about it and said she had
hard work getting sitters and Mr. Mills is ever so
patient.”</p>

<p>The intimacy implied in this kindled Bruce’s jealousy
anew. Dale Freeman, whose prescience was keen, saw
a look in his face that gave her instant pause.</p>

<p>“Mr. Mills and Leila are leaving in a few days,”
she remarked quickly. “I don’t believe he’s much of a
success as a matchmaker. It’s been in the air for
several years that Leila must marry Arthur Carroll,
but he doesn’t appear to be making any headway.”</p>

<p>“Leila will do as she pleases,” said Freeman, who
was satisfied with a very little gossip. “Bruce, how do
you feel about tackling that Laconia war memorial?”</p>

<p>Bruce’s native town was to build a museum as a
memorial to the soldiers in all her wars, from the
Revolutionary patriots who had settled the county to
the veterans of the Great War. Freeman had encouraged
Bruce to submit plans, which were to be passed
on by a jury of the highest distinction. Freeman kept
strictly to domestic architecture; but Bruce’s ideas about
the memorial had impressed him by their novelty. His
young associate had, he saw, a natural bent for monumental
structures that had been increased by the contemplation
of the famous memorials in Europe. They
went into the Freemans’ study to talk over the specifications
and terms of the competition, and by midnight
Bruce was so reassured by his senior’s confidence that
it was decided he should go to work immediately on
his plans.</p>

<p>“It would be splendid, Bruce!” said Dale, who had
sewed during the discussion, throwing in an occasional<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>
apt comment and suggestion. “The people of Laconia
would have all the more pride in their heroes if one
of them designed the memorial. It’s not big enough
to tempt the top-notchers in the profession, but if you
land it it will push you a long way up!”</p>

<p>“Yes; it would be a big thing for you,” Freeman
added. “You’d better drop your work in the office
and concentrate on it....”</p>

<p>Undeterred by the cold, Bruce drove daily into the
country, left his car and walked—walked with a new
energy begotten of definite ambition and faith in his
power of achievement. To create beautiful things:
this had been his mother’s prayer for him. He would
do this for her; he would create a thing of beauty
that should look down forever upon the earth that held
her dust.</p>

<p>The site of the proposed building was on the crest
of a hill on the outskirts of Laconia and within
sight of its main street. Bruce had known the spot
all his life and had no trouble in visualizing its pictorial
possibilities. The forest trees that crowned the
hill would afford a picturesque background for an open
colonnade that he meant to incorporate in his plans.</p>

<p>Walking on clear, cold nights he fancied that he saw
on every hilltop the structure as it would be, with the
winds playing through its arches and wistful young
moons coming through countless years to bless it anew
with the hope and courage of youth.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>On Shep’s account rather than because of any interest
he felt in Constance, Bruce had twice looked in
at the Shepherd Mills’s on Constance’s day at home.</p>

<p>Constance made much of the informality of her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>
“days,” but they were, Bruce thought, rather dull. The
girls and the young matrons he met there gave Mrs.
Shep the adoration her nature demanded; the few men
who dropped in were either her admirers or they went
in the hope of meeting other young women in whom
they were interested. On the first of these occasions
Bruce had found Leila and Fred Thomas there, and
both times George Whitford was prominent in the
picture.</p>

<p>Thomas was not without his attractions. His cherubic
countenance and the infantile expression of his
large myopic blue eyes made him appear younger than
his years. The men around the University Club said
he had a shrewd head for business; the women of the
younger set pronounced him very droll, a likely rival
of Bud Henderson for humor. It was easy to understand
why he was called Freddy; he had the look of a
Freddy. And Bruce thought it quite natural that
Leila Mills should fancy him.</p>

<p>Constance’s attempts to attract the artistic and intellectual
on her Thursdays had been a melancholy failure;
such persons were much too busy, and it had
occurred to the musicians, literary aspirants and
struggling artists in town that there was something a
little patronizing in her overtures. Her house was
too big; it was not half so agreeable as the Freemans’,
and of course Freeman was an artist himself and Dale
was intelligently sympathetic with everyone who had
an idea to offer. As Bud Henderson put it, Dale
could mix money and social position with art and nobody
thought of its being a mixture, whereas at Constance’s
you were always conscious of being either a
sheep or a goat. Connie’s upholstery was too expensive,
Bud thought, and her sandwiches were too elaborate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>
for the plebeian palates of goats inured to hot
ham in a bun in one-arm lunch rooms.</p>

<p>Gossip, like death, loves a shining mark, and Mrs.
Shepherd Mills was too conspicuous to escape the attention
of the manufacturers and purveyors of rumor
and scandal. The parochial habit of mind dies hard
in towns that leap to cityhood, and the delights of the
old time cosy gossip over the back fence are not lightly
relinquished. Bruce was appalled by the malicious
stories he heard about people he was beginning to know
and like. He had heard George Whitford’s name mentioned
frequently in connection with Connie’s, but he
thought little of it. He had, nevertheless, given due
weight to Helen Torrence’s warning to beware of
becoming one of Connie’s victims.</p>

<p>There was a good deal of flirting going on among
young married people, Bruce found, but it was of a
harmless sort. Towns of two and three hundred thousand
are too small for flirtations that pass the heavily
mined frontiers of discretion. Even though he had
weakly yielded to an impulse and kissed Connie the
night he drove her from the Freemans’ to Deer Trail,
he took it for granted that it had meant no more to
her than it had to him. And he assumed that on the
earlier afternoon, when he met Connie and Whitford
on the road, Whitford had probably been making love
to Connie and Connie had not been unwilling to be
made love to. There were women like that, he knew,
not infrequently young married women who, when the
first ardor of marriage has passed, seek to prolong
their youth by re-testing their charm for men. Shepherd
Mills was hardly a man to inspire a deep love in a
woman of Connie’s temperament; it was inevitable that
Connie should have her little fling.</p>

<p>On his way home from one of his afternoon tramps<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>
Bruce was moved to make his third call at the Shepherd
Mills’s. It was not Connie’s day at home,
but she had asked him to dinner a few nights earlier
when it was impossible for him to go and he hadn’t
been sure that she had accepted his refusal in good
part. He was cold and tired—happily tired, for the
afternoon spent in the wintry air had brought the solution
of several difficult questions touching the Laconia
memorial. His spirit had won the elation which workers
in all the arts experience when hazy ideas begin to
emerge into the foreground of consciousness and invite
consideration in terms of the tangible and concrete.</p>

<p>He would have stopped at the Hardens’ if he had
dared; lights shone invitingly from the windows as he
passed, but the Mills house, with its less genial façade,
deterred him. The thought of Millicent was inseparable
from the thought of Mills....</p>

<p>He hadn’t realized that it was so late until he had
rung the bell and looked at his watch under the entry
light. The maid surveyed him doubtfully, and sounds
of lively talk from within gave him pause. He was
about to turn away when Constance came into the hall.</p>

<p>“Oh, pleasantest of surprises!” she exclaimed. “Certainly
you’re coming in! There’s no one here but old
friends—and you’ll make another!”</p>

<p>“If it’s a party, I’m on my way,” he said hesitatingly.</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s just Nellie Burton and George Whitford—nothing
at all to be afraid of!”</p>

<p>At this moment Mrs. Burton and Whitford exhibited
themselves at the living-room door in proof of her
statement.</p>

<p>“Bully!” cried Whitford. “Of course Connie knew
you were coming!”</p>

<p>“I swear I didn’t!” Constance declared.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>“No matter if you did!” Whitford retorted.</p>

<p>Mrs. Burton clasped her hands devoutly as Bruce
divested himself of his overcoat. “We were just praying
for another man to come in—and here you are!”</p>

<p>“And a man who’s terribly hard to get, if you ask
me!” said Constance. “Come in to the fire. George,
don’t let Mr. Storrs perish for a drink!”</p>

<p>“He shall have gallons!” replied Whitford, turning
to a stand on which the materials for cocktail making
were assembled. “We needed a fresh thirst in the
party to give us a new excuse. ‘Stay me with
flagons’!”</p>

<p>“Now, <i>Bruce</i>,” drawled Constance. “<i>Did</i> I ever
call you <i>Bruce</i> before? Well, you won’t mind—say
you don’t mind! Shep calls you by your first name,
why not I?”</p>

<p>“This one is to dear old Shep—absent treatment!”
said Mrs. Burton as she took her glass.</p>

<p>“Shep’s in Cincinnati,” Constance was explaining.
“He went down on business yesterday and expected to
be home for dinner tonight—but he wired this forenoon
that he has to stay over. So first comes Nellie and
then old George blows in, and we were wishing for
another man to share our broth and porridge.”</p>

<p>“My beloved hubby’s in New York; won’t you be
my beau, Mr. Storrs?” asked Mrs. Burton.</p>

<p>“<i>Bruce!</i>” Constance corrected her.</p>

<p>“All right, then, Bruce! I’m Nellie to all the good
comrades.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Nellie,” said Bruce with affected shyness. He
regarded them amiably as they peppered him with a
brisk fire of questions as to where he had been and
why he made himself so inaccessible.</p>

<p>Mrs. Burton he knew but slightly. She was tall, an
extreme blonde and of about Constance’s age. Like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>
Constance, she was not of the older order of the local
nobility. Her father had been a manufacturer of
horsedrawn vehicles, and when the arrival of the gasoline
age destroyed his business he passed through bankruptcy
into commercial oblivion. However, the law
of compensations operated benevolently in Nellie’s
favor. She married Dick Burton, thereby acquiring
both social standing and a sound financial rating. She
was less intelligent than Constance, but more daring
in her social adventures outside the old conservative
stockade.</p>

<p>“George brought his own liquor,” said Constance.
“We have him to thank for this soothing mixture.
Shep’s terribly law-abiding; he won’t have the stuff
on the place. Bruce, you’re not going to boast of other
engagements; you’ll dine right here!”</p>

<p>“That’s all settled!” remarked Whitford cheerfully.</p>

<p>“If Bruce goes he takes me with him!” declared
Mrs. Burton. “I’m not going to be left here to watch
you two spoon. I’m some little spooner myself!”</p>

<p>“You couldn’t drive me from this house,” protested
Bruce.</p>

<p>“There spoke a real man!” cried Constance, and
she rang for the maid to order the table set for four.</p>

<p>Mrs. Burton, whom Bruce had met only once before,
became confidential when Constance and Whitford
went to the piano in the reception parlor, where Whitford
began improvising an air to some verses he had
written.</p>

<p>“Constance is always so lucky! All the men fall
in love with her. George has a terrible case—writes
poems to Connie’s eyes and everything!”</p>

<p>“Every woman should have her own poet,” said
Bruce. “I couldn’t make a rhyme to save my life!”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>“Oh, well, do me something in free verse; you don’t
need even an idea for that!”</p>

<p>“Ah, the reality doesn’t need metrical embellishment!”</p>

<p>“Thanks so much; I ought to have something clever
to hand back to you. Constance always know just
what to say to a man. I have the courage, but I
haven’t the brains for a first-class flirt.”</p>

<p>“Men are timid creatures,” he said mournfully. “I
haven’t the slightest initiative in these matters. You
are charming and the light of your eyes was stolen
from the stars. Does that have the right ring?”</p>

<p>“Well, hardly! You’re not intense enough! You
make me feel as though I were a freak of some kind.
Oh, George——”</p>

<p>“Yes, Nellie——” Whitford answered from the
piano.</p>

<p>“You must teach Bruce to flirt. His education’s
been neglected.”</p>

<p>“He’s in good hands now!” Whitford replied.</p>

<p>“Oh, Bruce is hopeless!” exclaimed Connie, who
was seated beside Whitford at the piano. “I gave
him a try-out and he refused to play!”</p>

<p>“Then I give up right now!” Mrs. Burton cried in
mock despair.</p>

<p>Bruce half suspected that she and Whitford had not
met at Constance’s quite as casually as they pretended.
But it was not his affair, and he was not averse to
making a fourth member of a party that promised at
least a little gaiety.</p>

<p>Mrs. Burton was examining him as to the range of
his acquaintance in the town, and what had prompted
him to settle there, and what he thought of the place—evoking
the admission (always expected of newcomers)
that it was a place singularly marked by its generous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>
hospitality—when she asked with a jerk of the head
toward Constance and Whitford:</p>

<p>“What would you do with a case like that?”</p>

<p>“What would I do with it?” asked Bruce, who had
been answering her questions perfunctorily, his mind
elsewhere. Constance and Whitford, out of sight in
the adjoining room, were talking in low tones to the
fitful accompaniment of the piano. Now and then
Constance laughed happily.</p>

<p>“It really oughtn’t to go on, you know!” continued
Mrs. Burton. “Those people are <i>serious</i>! But—what
is one to do?”</p>

<p>“My dear Nellie, I’m not a specialist in such matters!”
said Bruce, not relishing her evident desire to
discuss their hostess.</p>

<p>“Some of their friends—I’m one of them—are <i>worried</i>!
I know Helen Torrence has talked to Constance.
She really ought to catch herself up. Shep’s so blind—poor
boy! It’s a weakness of his to think everyone
perfectly all right!”</p>

<p>“It’s a noble quality,” remarked Bruce dryly. “You
don’t think Shep would object to this party?”</p>

<p>“There’s the point! Connie isn’t stupid, you know!
She asked me to come just so she could keep George
for dinner. And being a good fellow, I came! I’m
ever so glad you showed up. I might be suspected of
helping things along! But with you here the world
might look through the window!”</p>

<p>“Then we haven’t a thing to worry about!” said
Bruce with finality.</p>

<p>“It’s too bad,” she persisted, “that marriage isn’t an
insurance of happiness. Now George and Constance
are ideally suited to each other; but they never knew
it until it was too late. I wish he’d go to Africa or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>
some far-off place. If he doesn’t there’s going to be
an earthquake one of these days.”</p>

<p>“Well, earthquakes in this part of the world are
never serious,” Bruce remarked, uncomfortable as he
found that Constance’s friend was really serious and
appealing for his sympathy.</p>

<p>“You probably don’t know Franklin Mills—no one
does, for that matter—but with his strict views of
things there’d certainly be a big smash if <i>he</i> knew!”</p>

<p>“Well, of course there’s nothing for him to know,”
said Bruce indifferently.</p>

<p>The maid came in to announce dinner and Constance
and Whitford reappeared.</p>

<p>“George has been reciting lovely poetry to me,”
said Constance. “Nellie, has Bruce kept you amused?
I know he <i>could</i> make love beautifully if he only
<i>would</i>!”</p>

<p>“He’s afraid of me—or he doesn’t like me,” said
Mrs. Burton—“I don’t know which!”</p>

<p>“He looks guilty! He looks terribly guilty. I’m
sure he’s been making love to you!” said Constance
dreamily as though under the spell of happy memories.
“We’ll go in to dinner just as we are. These
informal parties are always the nicest.”</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>Whitford was one of those rare men who are equally
attractive to both men and women. Any prejudice
that might have been aroused in masculine minds by
his dilettantism was offset by his adventures as a
traveler, hunter and soldier.</p>

<p>“Now, heroes,” began Mrs. Burton, when they were
seated, “tell us some war stories. I was brought up
on my grandfather’s stories of the Civil War, but the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>
boys we know who went overseas to fight never talk
war at all!”</p>

<p>“No wonder!” exclaimed Whitford. “It was only
a little playful diversion among the nations. That
your idea, Storrs?”</p>

<p>“Nothing to it,” Bruce assented. “We had to go
to find out that the French we learned in school was
no good!”</p>

<p>Whitford chuckled and told a story of an encounter
with a French officer of high rank he had met one wet
night in a lonely road. The interview began with
the greatest courtesy, became violent as neither could
make himself intelligible to the other, and then, when
each was satisfied of the other’s honorable intentions,
they parted with a great flourish of compliments.
Bruce capped this with an adventure of his own, in
which his personal peril was concealed by his emphasis
on the ridiculous plight into which he got himself
by an unauthorized excursion through a barbed wire
entanglement for a private view of the enemy.</p>

<p>“That’s the way they all talk!” said Connie admiringly.
“You’d think the whole thing had been a huge
joke!”</p>

<p>“You’ve got to laugh at war,” observed Whitford,
“it’s the only way. It’s so silly to think anything can
be proved by killing a lot of people and making a lot
more miserable.”</p>

<p>“You laugh about it, but you might both have been
killed!” Mrs. Burton expostulated.</p>

<p>“No odds,” said Whitford, “except—that we’d have
missed this party!”</p>

<p>They played bridge afterward, though Whitford
said it would be more fun to match dollars. The
bridge was well under way when the maid passed down
the hall to answer the bell.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span>“Just a minute, Annie!” Constance laid down her
cards and deliberated.</p>

<p>“What’s the trouble, Connie? Is Shep slipping in
on us?” asked Mrs. Burton.</p>

<p>“Hardly,” replied Constance, plainly disturbed by
the interruption. “Oh, Annie, don’t let anyone in
you don’t know.”</p>

<p>They waited in silence for the opening of the door.</p>

<p>In a moment Franklin Mills’s voice was heard asking
if Mr. and Mrs. Mills were at home.</p>

<p>“Um!” With a shrug Constance rose hastily and
met Mills at the door.</p>

<p>“I’d like to see you just a moment, Connie,” he said
without prelude.</p>

<p>Whitford and Bruce had risen. Mills bowed to
them and to Mrs. Burton, but behind the mask of
courtesy his face wore a haggard look.</p>

<p>Constance followed him into the hall where their
voices—Mills’s low and tense—could be heard in hurried
conference. In a moment Constance went to the
hall telephone and called a succession of numbers.</p>

<p>“The club—Freddy Thomas’s rooms——” muttered
Whitford. “Wonder what’s up——”</p>

<p>They exchanged questioning glances. Whitford idly
shuffled and reshuffled the cards.</p>

<p>“He’s looking for Leila. Do you suppose——” began
Mrs. Burton in a whisper.</p>

<p>“You’re keeping score, aren’t you, Storrs?” asked
Whitford aloud.</p>

<p>They began talking with forced animation about the
game to hide their perturbation over Mills’s appearance
and his evident concern as to Leila’s whereabouts.</p>

<p>“Mr. Thomas is at the club,” they heard Constance
report. “He dined there alone.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span>“You’re sure Leila’s not been here—she’s not here
now?” Mills demanded irritably.</p>

<p>“I haven’t seen Leila at all today,” Constance replied
with patient deliberation. “I’m so sorry you’re
troubled. She’s probably stopped somewhere for dinner
and forgotten to telephone.”</p>

<p>“She usually calls me up. That’s what troubles
me,” Mills replied, “not hearing from her. There’s
no place else you’d suggest?”</p>

<p>“No——”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Connie. Shep’s still away?”</p>

<p>“Yes. He’ll be back tomorrow.”</p>

<p>Mills paused in the doorway and bowed to the trio
at the card table. “I’m sorry I interrupted your
game!” he said, forcing a smile. “Do pardon me!”</p>

<p>He turned up the collar of his fur-lined coat and
fumbled for the buttons. There seemed to Bruce a
curious helplessness in the slow movement of his
fingers.</p>

<p>Constance followed him to the outer door, and as it
closed upon him walked slowly back into the living
room.</p>

<p>“That’s a pretty how-d’ye-do! Leila ought to have
a whipping! It’s after eight and nothing’s been seen
of her since noon. But she hasn’t eloped—that’s one
satisfaction! Freddy’s at the club all right enough.”</p>

<p>“She’s certainly thrown a scare into her father,”
remarked Mrs. Burton. “He looked positively ill.”</p>

<p>“It’s too bad!” ejaculated Whitford. “I hope she
hasn’t got soused and smashed up her car somewhere.”</p>

<p>“I wish Freddy Thomas had never been born!” cried
Constance impatiently. “Leila and her father have
been having a nasty time over him. And she had cut
drinking and was doing fine!”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span>“Is there anything we can do?—that’s the question,”
said Whitford, taking a turn across the floor.</p>

<p>Bruce was thinking hard. What might Leila do in
a fit of depression over her father’s hostility toward
Thomas?...</p>

<p>“I think maybe——” he began. He did not finish,
but with sudden resolution put out his hand to Constance.
“Excuse me, won’t you? It’s just possible
that I may be able to help.”</p>

<p>“Let me go with you,” said Whitford quickly.</p>

<p>“No, thanks; Mr. Mills may come back and need
assistance. You’d better stay. If I get a clue I’ll
call up.”</p>

<p>It was a bitter night, the coldest of the year, and
he drove his car swiftly, throwing up the windshield
and welcoming the rush of cold air. He thought of
his drive with Shepherd to the river, and here he was
setting forth again in a blind hope of rendering a service
to one of Franklin Mills’s children!...</p>

<p>On the unlighted highway he had difficulty in finding
the gate that opened into the small tract on the
bluff above the boathouse where he had taken Leila
and Millicent on the summer evening when he had rescued
them from the sandbar. Leaving his car at the
roadside, he stumbled down the steps that led to the
water. He paused when he saw lights in the boathouse
and moved cautiously across the veranda that
ran around its land side. A vast silence hung upon
the place.</p>

<p>He opened the door and stood blinking into the room.
On a long couch that stretched under the windows
lay Leila, in her fur coat, with a rug half drawn over
her knees. Her hat had slipped to the floor and beside
it lay a silver flask and an empty whisky bottle. He
touched her cheek and found it warm; listened for a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span>
moment to her deep, uneven breathing, and gathered
her up in his arms.</p>

<p>He reached the door just as it opened and found
himself staring into Franklin Mills’s eyes—eyes in
which pain, horror and submission effaced any trace
of surprise.</p>

<p>“I—I followed your car,” Mills said, as if an explanation
of his presence were necessary. “I’m sure—you
are very—very kind——”</p>

<p>He stepped aside, and Bruce passed out, carrying
the relaxed body tenderly. As he felt his way slowly
up the icy steps he could hear Mills following.</p>

<p>The Mills limousine stood by the gate and the chauffeur
jumped out and opened the door. No words were
spoken. Mills got into the car slowly, unsteadily, in
the manner of a decrepit old man. When he was
seated Bruce placed Leila in his arms and drew the
carriage robe over them. The chauffeur mounted to
his place and snapped off the tonneau lights, and Bruce,
not knowing what he did, raised his hand in salute as
the heavy machine rolled away.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER SEVENTEEN</h2>
</div>


<h3>I</h3>

<p>The day following his discovery of Leila Mills in
the boathouse, Bruce remained in his apartment. He
was not a little awed by the instinct that had led him
to the river—the unlikeliest of places in which to seek
the runaway girl. The poor little drugged body lying
there in the cold room; her deep sigh and the touch
of her hand on his face as he took her up, and more
poignantly the look in Franklin Mills’s face when they
met at the door, remained with him, and he knew that
these were things he could never forget....</p>

<p>There was more of superstition and mysticism in
his blood than he had believed. Lounging about his
rooms, staring down at the bleak street as it whitened
in a brisk snowfall, his thoughts ranged the wide seas
of doubt and faith. Life was only a corridor between
two doors of mystery. Petty and contemptible seemed
the old familiar teachings about God. Men were not
rejecting God; they were merely misled as to his nature.
The spirit of man was only an infinitesimal particle
of the spirit that was God. No other person he had
ever talked with had offered so reasonable a solution
of the problem as Millicent.</p>

<p>Again he went over their talk on the golf course.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span>
Millicent had the clue—the clue to a reality no less
tangible and plausible because it was born of unreality.
And here was the beginning of wisdom: to abandon
the attempt to explain all things when so manifestly
life would become intolerable if the walls of mystery
through which man moves were battered down. As
near as he was able to express it, the soul required
room—all infinity, indeed, as the playground for its
proper exercise. The freer a man’s spirit the greater
its capacity for loving and serving its neighbor souls.
Somewhere in the illimitable horizons of which Millicent
dreamed it was imaginable that Something august
and supreme dominated the universe—Something only
belittled by every attempt to find a name for it....</p>

<p>Strange reflections for a healthy young mind in a
stalwart, vigorous young body! Bruce hardly knew
himself today. The scent of Leila’s hair as he bore
her out of the boathouse had stirred a tenderness in
his heart that was strange to him. He hoped Franklin
Mills had dealt leniently with Leila. He had no idea
what the man would do or say after finding his daughter
in such a plight. He considered telephoning Mills’s
house to ask about her, but dismissed the thought.
His duty was discharged the moment he gave her into
her father’s keeping; in all the circumstances an inquiry
would be an impertinence.</p>

<p>Poor Leila! Poor, foolish, wilful, generous-hearted
little girl! Her father was much too conspicuous for
her little excursions among the shoals of folly to pass
unremarked. Bruce found himself excusing and defending
her latest escapade. She had taken refuge in
the oblivion of alcohol as an escape from her troubles....
Something wrong somewhere. Shep and
Leila both groping in the dark for the door of happiness
and getting no help from their father in their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span>
search—a deplorable situation. Not altogether Franklin
Mills’s fault; perhaps no one’s fault; just the way
things happen, but no less tragic for all that.</p>

<p>Bruce asked the janitor to bring in his meals, content
to be alone, looking forward to a long day in which
to brood over his plans for the memorial. He was
glad that he had not run away from Franklin Mills.
It was much better to have remained in the town, and
more comfortable to have met Mills and the members
of his family than to have lived in the same community
speculating about them endlessly without ever knowing
them. He knew them now all too well! Even Franklin
Mills was emerging from the mists; Bruce began
to think he knew what manner of man Mills was. Shepherd
had opened his own soul to him; and Leila—Bruce
made allowances for Leila and saw her merits
with full appreciation. One thing was certain: he
did not envy Franklin Mills or his children their lot;
he coveted nothing they possessed. He thanked his
stars that he had had the wit to reject Mills’s offer to
help him into a business position of promise; to be
under obligation of any sort to Franklin Mills would
be intolerable. Through the afternoon he worked
desultorily on his sketches of the Laconia memorial,
enjoying the luxury of undisturbed peace. He began
combining in a single drawing his memoranda of details;
was so pleased with the result in crayon that he
began a pen and ink sketch and was still at this when
Henderson appeared, encased in a plaid overcoat that
greatly magnified his circumference.</p>

<p>“What’s responsible for this!” Bruce demanded.</p>

<p>“Thanks for your hearty greeting! I called your
office at five-minute intervals all day and that hard-boiled
telephone girl said you hadn’t been there. All
the clubs denied knowledge of your whereabouts, so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span>
I clambered into my palatial Plantagenet and sped out,
expecting to find you sunk in mortal illness. You must
stop drinking, son.”</p>

<p>“That’s a good one from you! Please don’t sit on
those drawings!”</p>

<p>“My mistake. You’re terribly peevish. By the way—what
was the row last night about Leila Mills?”
Bud feigned deep interest in a cloisonné jar that stood
on the table.</p>

<p>“Well, what was?” asked Bruce. “I might have
known you had something up your sleeve.”</p>

<p>“Oh, the kid disappeared yesterday long enough to
give her father heart failure. Mills called Maybelle
to see if she was at our house; Maybelle called Connie,
and Connie said you’d left a party at her house to
chase the kidnappers. Of course I’m not asking any
questions, but I do like to keep pace with the local
news.”</p>

<p>“I’ll say you do!” Bruce grinned at him provokingly.
“Did they catch the kidnappers?”</p>

<p>“Well, Connie called Maybelle later to say that
Leila was all safe at home and in bed. But even Connie
didn’t know where you found the erring lambkin.”</p>

<p>“You’ve called the wrong number,” Bruce said,
stretching himself. “I didn’t find Miss Leila. When
I left Connie’s I went to the club to shoot a little pool.”</p>

<p>“You certainly lie like a gentleman! Come on home
with me to dinner; we’re going to have corn beef and
cabbage tonight!”</p>

<p>“In other words, if you can’t make me talk you
think Maybelle can!”</p>

<p>“You insult me! Get your hat and let’s skip!”</p>

<p>“No; I’m taking my nourishment right here today.
Strange as it may seem—I’m working!”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span>“Thanks for the hint! Just for that I hope the
job’s a failure.”</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>Bruce was engrossed at his drawing-board when, at
half past eight, the tinkle of the house telephone startled
him.</p>

<p>“Mr. Storrs? This is Mr. Mills speaking—may I
trouble you for a moment?”</p>

<p>“Yes; certainly. Come right up, Mr. Mills!”</p>

<p>There was no way out of it. He could not deny
himself to Mills. Bruce hurriedly put on his coat,
cleared up the litter on his table, straightened the
cushions on the divan and went into the hall to receive
his guest. He saw Mills’s head and shoulders below;
Mills was mounting slowly, leaning heavily upon the
stair rail. At the first landing—Bruce’s rooms were
on the third floor—Mills paused and drew himself
erect. Bruce stepped inside the door to avoid embarrassing
his caller on his further ascent.</p>

<p>“It’s a comfort not to have all the modern conveniences,”
Mills remarked graciously when Bruce
apologized for the stairs. “Thank you, no; I’ll not
take off my coat. You’re nicely situated here—I got
your number from Carroll; he can always answer any
question.”</p>

<p>His climb had evidently wearied him and he twisted
the head of his cane nervously as he waited for his
heart to resume its normal beat. There was a tired
look in his eyes and his face lacked its usual healthy
color. If Mills had come to speak of Leila, Bruce
resolved to make the interview as easy for him as
possible.</p>

<p>“Twenty-five years ago this was cow pasture,” Mills<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span>
remarked. “My father owned fifty acres right here
when I was a boy. He sold it for twenty times its
original cost.”</p>

<p>Whatever had brought Franklin Mills to Bruce’s
door, the man knew exactly what he had come to say,
but was waiting until he could give full weight to the
utterance. In a few minutes he was quite himself,
and to Bruce’s surprise he rose and stood, with something
of the ceremonial air of one about to deliver a
message whose nature demanded formality.</p>

<p>“Mr. Storrs, I came to thank you for the great service
you rendered me last night. I was in very great
distress. You can understand my anxious concern; so
I needn’t touch upon that. Words are inadequate to
express my gratitude. But I can at least let you know
that I appreciate what you did for me—for me and
my daughter.”</p>

<p>He ended with a slight inclination of the head.</p>

<p>“Thank you, Mr. Mills,” said Bruce, taking the hand
Mills extended. “I hope Miss Mills is quite well.”</p>

<p>“Quite, thank you.”</p>

<p>With an abrupt change of manner that dismissed
the subject Mills glanced about the room.</p>

<p>“You bring work home? That speaks for zeal in
your profession. Aren’t the days long enough?”</p>

<p>“Oh, this is a little private affair,” said Bruce, noting
that Mills’s gaze had fallen upon the drawings propped
against the wall. It was understood between him and
the Freemans that his participation in the Laconia competition
was to be kept secret; but he felt moved to
explain to Mills the nature of the drawings. The man
had suffered in the past twenty-four hours—it would
be ungenerous to let him go without making some attempt
to divert his thoughts from Leila’s misbehavior.</p>

<p>“This may interest you, Mr. Mills; I mean the general<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span>
proposition—not my little sketches. Only—it must
be confidential!”</p>

<p>“Yes; certainly,” Mills smiled a grave assent. “Perhaps
you’d rather not tell me—I’m afraid my curiosity
got the better of my manners.”</p>

<p>“Oh, not that, sir! Mr. and Mrs. Freeman know,
of course; but I don’t want to have to explain my
failure in case I lose! I’m glad to tell you about it;
you may have some suggestions.”</p>

<p>Mills listened as Bruce explained the requirements
of the Laconia memorial and illustrated with the drawings
what he proposed to offer.</p>

<p>“Laconia?” Mills repeated the name quickly. “How
very interesting!”</p>

<p>“You may recall the site,” Bruce went on, displaying
a photograph of the hilltop.</p>

<p>“I remember the place very well; there couldn’t be
a finer site. I suppose the town owns the entire hill?
That’s a fine idea—to adjust the building to that bit
of forest; the possibilities are enormous for effective
handling. There should be a fitting approach—terraces,
perhaps a fountain directly in front of the entrance—something
to prepare the eye as the visitor
ascends——”</p>

<p>“That hadn’t occurred to me!” said Bruce. “It
would be fine!”</p>

<p>Mills, his interest growing, slipped out of his overcoat
and sat down in the chair beside the drawing
board.</p>

<p>“Those colonnades extending at both sides give
something of the effect of wings—buoyancy is what
I mean,” he remarked. “I like the classical severity
of the thing. Beauty can be got with a few lines—but
they must be the right ones. Nature’s a sound
teacher there.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span>Bruce forgot that there was any tie between them;
Laconia became only a place where a soldiers’ memorial
was to be constructed. Mills’s attitude toward the
project was marked by the restraint, the diffidence of a
man of breeding wary of offending but eager to help.
Bruce had seen at once the artistic value of the
fountain. He left Mills at the drawing table and paced
the floor, pondering it. The look of weariness left
Mills’s face. He was watching with frankly admiring
eyes the tall figure, the broad, capable shoulders, the
finely molded head, the absorbed, perplexed look in
the handsome face. Not like Shep; not like any other
young man he knew was this Bruce Storrs. He had
not expected to remain more than ten minutes, but
he was finding it difficult to leave.</p>

<p>Remembering that he had a guest, Bruce glanced at
Mills and caught the look in his face. For a moment
both were embarrassed.</p>

<p>“Do pardon me!” Bruce exclaimed quickly. “I was
just trying to see my way through a thing or two. I’m
afraid I’m boring you.”</p>

<p>Mills murmured a denial and took a cigarette from
the box Bruce extended.</p>

<p>“How much money is there to spend on this? I
was just thinking that that’s an important point. Public
work of this sort is often spoiled by lack of funds.”</p>

<p>“Three hundred thousand is the limit. Mr. Freeman
warns me that it’s hardly enough for what I propose,
and that I’ve got to do some trimming.”</p>

<p>He drew from a drawer the terms of the competition
and the specifications, and smoked in silence while
Mills looked them over.</p>

<p>“It’s all clear enough. It’s a joint affair—the county
does half and the rest is a popular subscription?”</p>

<p>“Yes; the local committee are fine people; too bad<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span>
they haven’t enough to do the thing just right,” Bruce
replied. “Of course I mean the way I’d like to do it—with
your idea of the fountain that I’d rejoice to
steal!”</p>

<p>“That’s a joke—that I could offer a trained artist
any suggestion of real value!”</p>

<p>Bruce was finding his caller a very different Franklin
Mills from the man he had talked with in the Jefferson
Avenue house, and not at all the man whom,
in his rôle of country squire, he had seen at Deer
Trail. Mills was enjoying himself; there was no question
of that. He lighted a cigar—the cigar he usually
smoked at home before going to bed.</p>

<p>“You will not be known as a competitor; your plans
will go in anonymously?” he inquired.</p>

<p>“Yes; that’s stipulated,” Bruce replied.</p>

<p>Returning to the plans—they seemed to have a fascination
for Mills—one of his questions prompted
Bruce to seize a pencil and try another type of entrance.
Mills stood by, watching the free swift movement
of the strong hand.</p>

<p>“I’m not so sure that’s better than your first idea.
I’ve always heard that a first inspiration is likely to
be the best—providing always that it is an inspiration!
I’d give a lot if I could do what you’ve just
done with that pencil. I suppose it’s a knack; you’re
born with it. You probably began young; such talent
shows itself early.”</p>

<p>“I can’t remember a time when I didn’t like to fool
with a pencil. My mother gave me my first lessons.
She had a very pretty talent—sketched well and did
water colors—very nice ones, too. That’s one of them
over there—a corner of our garden in the old home at
Laconia.”</p>

<p>Mills walked slowly across the room to look at a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span>
framed water color that hung over Bruce’s writing
table.</p>

<p>“Yes; I can see that it’s good work. I remember
that garden—I seem to remember this same line of
hollyhocks against the brick wall.”</p>

<p>“Oh, mother had that every year! Her flowers
were famous in Laconia.”</p>

<p>“And that sun-dial—I seem to remember that, too,”
Mills observed meditatively.</p>

<p>“Mother liked that sort of thing. We used to sit
out there in the summer. She made a little festival of
the coming of spring. I think all the birds in creation
knew her as friend. And the neighbor children came
in to hear her read—fairy stories and poetry. We
had jolly good times there—mother and I!”</p>

<p>“I’m sure you did,” said Mills gravely.</p>

<p>As he stepped away from the table his eyes fell upon
the photograph of a young woman in a silver frame.
He bent down for a closer inspection. Bruce turned
away, walked the length of the room and glanced
round to find Mills still regarding the photograph.</p>

<p>“My mother, as she was at about thirty,” Bruce
remarked.</p>

<p>“Yes; I thought so. Somewhat older than when I
knew her, but the look of youth is still there.”</p>

<p>“I prefer that to any other picture of her I have.
She refused to be photographed in her later years—said
she didn’t want me to think of her as old. And
she never was that—could never have been.”</p>

<p>“I can well believe it,” said Mills softly. “Time
deals gently with spirits like hers.”</p>

<p>“No one was ever like her,” said Bruce with feeling.
“She made the world a kindlier and nobler place by
living in it.”</p>

<p>“And you’re loyal to the ideal she set for you! You<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[274]</span>
think of her, I’m sure, in all you do—in all you mean
to do.”</p>

<p>“Yes, it helps—it helps a lot to feel that somewhere
she knows and cares.”</p>

<p>Mills picked up a book, scanned the title page unseeingly
and threw it down.</p>

<p>“I’ve just about killed an evening for you,” he said
with a smile and put out his hand cordially. “My
chauffeur is probably frozen.”</p>

<p>“You’ve been a big help!” replied Bruce. “It’s been
fine to have you here. I’ll see Mr. Freeman tomorrow
and go over the whole thing again. He may be able
to squeeze the fountain out of the appropriation! May
I tell him it’s your idea?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no! No, indeed! Just let my meddlesomeness
be a little joke between us. I shall be leaving town
shortly and may not see you again for several months.
So good-bye and good luck!”</p>

<p>Bruce walked downstairs with him. At the entrance
they again shook hands, as if the good will on both
sides demanded this further expression of amity.</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>A brief item in the “Personal and Society” column
of an afternoon newspaper apprised Bruce a few days
later of the departure of Mr. Franklin Mills and Miss
Leila Mills for the Mediterranean, they having abandoned
their proposed trip to Bermuda for the longer
voyage. Bruce wondered a little at the change of
plans, suspecting that it might in some degree be a
disciplinary measure for Leila’s benefit, a scheme for
keeping her longer under her father’s eye. He experienced
a curious new loneliness at the thought
of their absence and then was impatient to find himself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span>
giving them a second thought. A month earlier
he would have been relieved by the knowledge that
Mills was gone and that the wide seas rolled between
them. An amazing thing, this! To say they were
nothing to him did not help now as in those first months
after he had established himself in Mills’s town. They
meant a good deal to him and perhaps he meant something
to them. It was very odd indeed how he and
the Millses circled about each other.</p>

<p>As he put down the newspaper a note was brought
to him at his apartment by Mills’s chauffeur. It read:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Dear Bruce: You said I might; I can’t just Mr.
Storrs you! Trunks at the station and Dada waiting
at the front door. I couldn’t bear the idea of writing
you a note you’d read while I was still in town—so
please consider that I’m throwing you a kiss from the
tail end of the observation car. I could never, never
have had the courage to <i>say</i> my thanks to you—if I
tried I’d cry and make a general mess of it. But—I
want you to <i>know</i> that I do appreciate it—what you
did—in saving my life and every little thing! I’d
probably have died all right enough in the frightful
cold if you hadn’t found me. I really didn’t know
till yesterday, when I wormed it out of Dada, just how
it all happened! I’m simply crushed! I promise I’ll
never do such a thing again. Thank you <i>loads</i>, and
be sure I’ll never forget. I wish you were my big
brother; I’d just adore being a nice, good little sister
to you. Love and kisses, from</p>

<p class="right">Leila.</p>
</div>

<p>He reread it a dozen times in the course of the evening.
It was so like the child—the perverse, affectionate
child—that Leila was. “<i>I wish you were
my big brother.</i>” The sentence had slipped from her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span>
flying pen thoughtlessly, no doubt, but it gave Bruce a
twinge. Shep did not know; Leila did not know! and
yet for both of these children of Franklin Mills he
felt a fondness that was beyond ordinary friendship.
Shep could never be, in the highest sense, a companion
of his father; Mills no doubt loved Leila, but he loved
her without understanding. Her warm, passionate
heart, the very fact that she and Shep were the children
of Franklin Mills made life difficult for them.
Either would have been happier if they had not been
born into the Mills caste. The Mills money and the
Mills position were an encumbrance against which more
or less consciously they were in rebellion.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER EIGHTEEN</h2>
</div>


<h3>I</h3>

<p>It was ten days later that a communication from
the Laconia War Memorial Association gave warning
that the stipulations for the contesting architects were
being altered, and in another week Bruce received the
supplemental data sent out to all the contestants. The
amount to be expended had been increased by an unexpected
addition to the private subscriptions.</p>

<p>In one of his first fits of homesickness Bruce had subscribed
for the Laconia Examiner to keep in touch
with affairs in his native town. The paper printed
with a proud flourish the news of the augmentation of
the fund. One hundred thousand dollars had been
contributed through a New York trust company by
“a citizen” whose identity for good and sufficient
reasons was not to be disclosed. The trust company’s
letter as quoted in the Examiner recited that the
donation was from a “patriotic American who, recognizing
the fine spirit in which Laconia had undertaken
the memorial and the community’s desire that it should
be an adequate testimony to the valor and sacrifice of
American youth, considered it a high privilege to be
permitted to assist.”</p>

<p>Mills! Though the Laconia newspaper was evidently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[278]</span>
wholly at sea as to the identity of the
contributor, Bruce was satisfied that Mills was the unknown
donor. And he resented it. The agreeable impression
left by Mills the evening they discussed the plans was
dispelled by this unwarranted interference. Bruce
bitterly regretted having taken Mills into his confidence.
Mills’s interest had pleased him, but he had
never dreamed that the man might feel moved to add
to the attractiveness of the contest by a secret
contribution to the fund. He felt strongly moved to
abandon the whole thing and but for the embarrassment
of explaining himself to Freeman he would have
done so. But the artist in him prevailed. Mills had
greatly broadened the possibilities of the contest and in
a few days Bruce fell to work with renewed enthusiasm.</p>

<p>He was living in Laconia again, so engrossed did
he become in his work. He dined with Carroll now
and then, enjoyed long evenings at the Freemans’ and
kept touch with the Hendersons; but he refused so
many invitations to the winter functions that Dale protested.
He dropped into the Central States Trust Company
now and then to observe Shep in his new rôle of
vice-president. Shep was happier in the position than
he had expected to be. Carroll was seeing to it that he
had real work to do, work that was well within his
powers. He had charge of the savings department and
was pleased when his old friends among the employees
of the battery plant looked him up and opened accounts.
The friends of the Mills family, where they
took note of Shep’s transfer at all, saw in it a
promotion.</p>

<p>Bruce, specially importuned by telephone, went to
one of Constance’s days at home, which drew a large
attendance by reason of the promised presence of an
English novelist whose recent severe criticism of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span>
American society and manners had made him the object
of particular adoration to American women readers.
Bud Henderson, who had carried a flask to the tea,
went about protesting against the consideration shown
the visitor. If, he said, an American writer criticized
American women in any such fashion he would be
lynched, but let an Englishman do it and women would
steal the money out of their children’s banks to buy
his books and lecture tickets. So spake Bud. If Bud
had had two flasks he would have broken up the tea;
restricted as he was, his protest against the Briton
took the form of an utterly uncalled for attack upon
the drama league delivered to an aunt of Maybelle’s
who was president of the local society—a strong
Volsteadian who thought Bud vulgar, which at times Bud,
by any high social standard, indubitably was. However,
if amid so many genuflections the eminent Briton
was disturbed by Bud’s evil manners or criticisms,
Bud possibly soothed his feelings by following him
upstairs when the party was dispersing and
demonstrating the manner in which American law is
respected by drawing flasks from nine out of fifteen
overcoats laid out on Constance’s guest room bed and
pouring half a pint of excellent bourbon into the
unresisting man of letters.</p>

<p>This function was only an interlude in the city’s
rather arid social waste. The local society, Bruce
found, was an affair of curiously close groupings. The
women of the ancestral crowd were so wary of the
women who had floated in on the tide of industrial
expansion that one might have thought the newcomers
were, in spite of their prosperity, afflicted with leprosy....</p>

<p>While Bruce might bury himself from the sight of
others who had manifested a friendly interest in him,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span>
Helen Torrence was not so easily denied. She had no
intention of going alone to the February play of the
Dramatic Club. She telephoned Bruce to this effect
and added that he must dine with her that evening and
take her to the club. Bud had already sent him an
admission card with a warning not to come if anything
better offered, such as sitting up with a corpse—this
being Bud’s manner of speaking of the organization
whose politics he dominated and whose entertainments
he would not have missed for a chance to dine with
royalty.</p>

<p>Bruce, having reached the Torrence house, found
Millicent there.</p>

<p>“You see what you get for being good!” cried
Helen, noting the surprise and pleasure in Bruce’s
face as he appeared in her drawing room.</p>

<p>“I thought you’d probably run when you saw me,”
said Millicent. “You passed me at the post office door
yesterday and looked straight over my head. I never
felt so small in my life.”</p>

<p>“Post office?” Bruce repeated. “I haven’t been near
the place for weeks!”</p>

<p>“That will do from you!” warned Helen. “We all
thought you’d be a real addition to our sad social
efforts here, but it’s evident you don’t like us. It’s
very discouraging. You were at Connie’s, though, to
hear her lion roar. I saw you across the room. Connie
always gets the men! Your friend Bud insulted
everybody there; I see him selling any more Plantagenets!”</p>

<p>“Bud’s patriotism leads him astray sometimes;
that’s all. Any more scolding, Millicent?” Bruce
asked. “Let me see—we had arrived at the stage of
first names, hadn’t we?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Bruce! But after the long separation it might<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span>
be as well to go back to the beginning. As for scolding,
let’s consider that we’ve signed an armistice.”</p>

<p>“I don’t like the military lingo; it sounds as though
there had been war between us.”</p>

<p>“Dear me!” Helen interposed mournfully. “You’re
not going to spend the whole evening in preliminaries!
Let’s go out to dinner.”</p>

<p>After they were seated Bruce was still rather more
self-conscious than was comfortable. Nothing had
happened; or more truthfully, nothing had happened
except that he had been keeping away from Millicent
because of Franklin Mills. She evidently was not displeased
to see him again. He had not realized how
greatly he had missed her till her voice touched chords
that had vibrated at their first meeting. Her eyes had
the same steady light and kindled responsively to any
demand of mirth; her hair had the same glint of gold.
He marveled anew at her poise and ease. Tonight
her gown, of a delicate shade of crimson, seemed a
subdued reflection of her bright coloring. He floundered
badly in his attempts to bring some spirit to the
conversation. It seemed stupid to ask Millicent about
her music or inquire how her modeling was coming on
or what she had been reading. He listened with forced
attention while she and Helen compared notes on recent
social affairs in which they had participated.</p>

<p>“Millie, you don’t really like going about—teas and
that sort of thing,” said Helen. “I know you don’t.
All you girls who have ideas are like that.”</p>

<p>“Ideas! Dearest Helen, are you as easily deceived as
that! Sometimes there are things I’d rather do than
go to parties! Does one really have to keep going
to avoid seeming queer?”</p>

<p>“I go because I haven’t the brains to do anything
else. I like wandering with the herd. It just thrills<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span>
me to get into a big jam. And I suppose I show
myself whenever I’m asked for fear I’ll be forgotten!”</p>

<p>“My sole test of a social function is whether they
feed me standing or sitting,” said Bruce when appealed
to. “I can bear anything but that hideous sensation
that my plate is dripping.”</p>

<p>“That’s why men hate teas,” observed Helen. “It’s
because of the silly refreshments no one wants and
everybody must have or the hostess is broken-hearted.”</p>

<p>“That’s probably where jailers got the idea of forcible
feeding,” Millicent suggested.</p>

<p>“At the Hendersons’,” Bruce added, “only the drinks
are compulsory. Bud’s social symbol is the cocktail-shaker!”</p>

<p>“Everybody drinks too much;” said Helen, “except
us. Bruce, help yourself to the sherry.”</p>

<p>“What is a perfect social occasion?” Bruce asked.
“My own ideas are a little muddled, but you—Helen?”</p>

<p>“If you must know the truth—there is no such thing!
However, you might ask Millicent; she’s an optimist.”</p>

<p>“A perfect time is sitting in the middle of the floor
in my room cutting paper dolls,” Millicent answered.
“I’m crazy about it. Leila says it’s the best thing
I do.”</p>

<p>“Do you ever exhibit your creations?” asked Bruce
solicitously.</p>

<p>“We’ve got her in a trap now,” exclaimed Helen.
“Millie takes her paper dolls to the sick children in
the hospitals. I know, because the children told me.
I was at the City Hospital the other day and peeped
into the children’s ward. Much excitement—a vast
population of paper dolls dressed in the latest modes.
The youngsters were so tickled! They said a beautiful
lady had brought them—a most wonderful, beautiful
lady. And she was going to come back with paper<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[283]</span>
and scissors and show them just how they were made!”</p>

<p>“They’re such dear, patient little angels,” murmured
Millicent. “You feel better about all humanity when
you see how much courage there is in the world. It’s
a pretty brave old world after all.”</p>

<p>“It’s the most amazing thing about life,” said Bruce,
“that so many millions rise up every morning bent on
doing their best. You’d think the whole human race
would have given up the struggle long ago and jumped
into the sea. But no! Poor boobs that we are, we
go whistling right along. Frankly, I mean to hang on
a couple of weeks longer. Silly old world—but—it
has its good points.”</p>

<p>“Great applause!” exclaimed Helen, satisfied now
that her little party was not to prove an utter failure.
These were two interesting young people, she knew,
and she was anxious to hear their views on matters
about which she troubled herself more than most people
suspected.</p>

<p>“I’ve wondered sometimes,” Millicent said, “what
would happen if the world could be made altogether
happy just once by a miracle of some kind, no heartache
anywhere; no discomfort! How long would it
last?”</p>

<p>“Only till some person among the millions wanted
something another one had; that would start the old
row over again,” Bruce answered.</p>

<p>“I see what you children mean,” said Helen seriously.
“Selfishness is what makes the world unhappy!”</p>

<p>“Now—we’re getting in deep!” Bruce exclaimed.
“Millicent always swims for the open water.”</p>

<p>“Millie ought to go about lecturing; telling people
to be calm, to look more at the stars and less at their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[284]</span>
neighbors’ new automobiles. I believe that would do
a lot of good,” said Helen.</p>

<p>“A splendid idea!” Bruce declared, laughing into
Millicent’s eyes. “But what a sacrifice of herself! A
wonderful exhibition of unselfishness, but——”</p>

<p>“I’d be stoned to death!”</p>

<p>“You’d be surer of martyrdom if you told them to
love their neighbors as themselves,” said Helen. “Seriously
now, that’s the hardest thing there is to do!
Love my neighbor as myself! Me! Why, on one
side my neighbor’s children snowball my windows;
on the other side there’s a chimney that ruins me paying
cleaner’s bills. Perhaps you’d speak to them for
me, Millie?”</p>

<p>“See here!” exclaimed Millicent. “Where do you
get this idea of using me as a missionary and policeman!
I don’t feel any urge to reform the world!
I’m awful busy tending to my own business.”</p>

<p>“Oh, all right,” said Bruce with a sigh of resignation.
“Let the world go hang, then, if you won’t
save it!”</p>

<p>Helen was dressing the salad, and Bruce was free
to watch Millicent’s eyes as they filled with dreams.
As at other times when some grave mood touched her,
it seemed that she became another being, exploring
some realm alien to common experience. He glanced
at her hands, folded quietly on the edge of the table,
and again at her dream-filled eyes. Hers was the
repose of a nature schooled in serenity. The world
might rage in fury about her, but amid the tempest
her soul would remain unshaken....</p>

<p>Helen, to whom silence was always disturbing, looked
up, but stifled an apology for the unconscionable time
she was taking with the salad when she saw Millicent’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[285]</span>
face, and Bruce’s intent, reverent gaze fixed upon the
girl.</p>

<p>“Saving the world!” Millicent repeated deliberatingly.
“I never quite like the idea. It rather suggests—doesn’t
it?—that some new machinery or method
must be devised for saving it. But the secret came
into the world ever so long ago—it was the ideal of
beauty. A Beautiful Being died that man might know
the secret of happiness. It had to be that way or
man would never have understood or remembered.
It’s not His fault that his ideas have been so confused
and obscured in the centuries that have passed since
He came. It’s man’s fault. The very simplicity of
His example has always bewildered man; it was too
good to be true!”</p>

<p>“But, Millie,” said Helen with a little embarrassed
laugh, “does the world really want to live as Jesus
lived? Or would it admire people who did? Somebody
said once that Christianity isn’t a failure because
it’s never been tried. Will it <i>ever</i> be tried—does anyone
care enough?”</p>

<p>“Dear me! What have I gotten into?” Millicent
picked up her fork and glanced at them smilingly.
“Bruce, don’t look so terribly solemn! Why, people
are trying it every day, at least pecking at it a little.
I’ve caught you at it lots of times! While we sit here,
enjoying this quite wonderful salad, scores of people
are doing things to make the world a better place to
live in—safer, kinder and happier. I saw a child walk
out of the hospital the other day who’d been carried in,
a pitiful little cripple. It was a miracle; and if you’d
seen the child’s delight and the look in the face of the
doctor whose genius did the work, you’d have thought
the secret of Jesus is making some headway!”</p>

<p>“And knowing the very charming young woman<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[286]</span>
named Millicent who found that little crippled girl
and took her to the hospital. I’d have thought a lot
more things!”</p>

<p>“I never did it!” Millicent cried.</p>

<p>“She’s always up to such tricks!” Helen informed
Bruce. “Paper dolls are only one item of Millie’s
good works.”</p>

<p>“Be careful!” Millicent admonished. “I could tell
some stories on you that might embarrass you terribly.”
She turned to Bruce with a lifting of the
brows that implied their hostess’s many shameless
excursions in philanthropy.</p>

<p>“How grand it would be if we could all talk about
serious things—life, religion and things like that—as
Millie does,” remarked Helen. “Most people talk of
religion as though it were something disgraceful.”</p>

<p>“Or they take the professional tone of the undertaker
telling a late pallbearer where to sit,” Bruce
added, “and the pallbearer is always deaf and insists
on getting into the wrong place and sitting on someone’s
hat.”</p>

<p>“How jolly! Anything to cheer up a funeral,” said
Helen. “Go on, Millie, and talk some more. You’re
a lot more comforting than Doctor Lindley.”</p>

<p>“The Doctor’s fine,” said Millicent spiritedly. “I
don’t go to church because half of me is heathen, I
suppose.” She paused as though a little startled by
the confession. “There are things about churches—some
of the hymns, the creed, the attempts to explain
the Scriptures—that don’t need explaining—that rub
me the wrong way. But it isn’t fair to criticize Doctor
Lindley or any other minister who’s doing the best
he can to help the world when the times are against him.
No one has a harder job than a Christian minister of
his training and traditions who really knows what’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[287]</span>
the trouble with the world and the church but is in
danger of being burned as a heretic if he says what
he thinks.”</p>

<p>“People can’t believe any more, can they, what their
grandfathers believed? It’s impossible—with science
and everything,” suggested Helen vaguely.</p>

<p>“Why should they?” asked Millicent. “I liked to
believe that God moves forward with the world. He
has outgrown His own churches; it’s their misfortune
that they don’t realize it. And Jesus, the Beautiful
One, walks through the modern world weighted down
with a heavier cross than the one he died on—bigotry,
intolerance, hatred—what a cruel thing that men
should hate one another in His name! I’ve wondered
sometimes what Jesus must think of all the books that
have been written to explain Him—mountains of books!
Jesus is the only teacher the world ever had who got
His whole story into one word—a universal word, an
easy word to say, and the word that has inspired all
the finest deeds of man. He rested His case on that,
thinking that anything so simple would never be misunderstood.
At the hospital one day I heard a mother
say to her child, a pitiful little scrap who was doomed
to die, ‘I love you so!’ and the wise, understanding
little baby said, ‘Me know you do.’ I think that’s an
answer to the charge that Christianity is passing out.
It can’t, you see, because it’s founded on the one thing
in the world that can never die.”</p>

<p>The room was very still. The maid, who had been
arrested in the serving of the dinner by a gesture from
Helen, furtively made the sign of the cross. The
candle flames bent to some imperceptible stirring of the
quiet air. Bruce experienced a sense of vastness, of
the immeasurable horizons of Millicent’s God and a
world through which the Beautiful One wandered still,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[288]</span>
symbolizing the ineffable word of His gospel that was
not for one people, or one sect, not to be bound up into
one creed, but written into the hearts of all men as
their guide to happiness. It seemed to him that the
girl’s words were part of some rite of purification that
had cleansed and blessed the world.</p>

<p>“I hadn’t thought of it in quite that way,” said
Bruce thoughtfully.</p>

<p>Helen was a wise woman and knew the perils of
anticlimax. She turned and nodded to the maid.</p>

<p>“Please forgive me! I’ve been holding back the
dinner!” Millicent exclaimed. “You must always stop
me when I begin riding the clouds. Bruce, are you
seeing Dale Freeman these days? Of course you are!
Helen, we must study Dale more closely. She knows
how to bring Bruce running!”</p>

<p>“I cheerfully yield to Dale in everything,” said
Helen. “I must watch the time. They promise an
unusually good show tonight—three one-act pieces and
one of them by George Whitford; he and Connie are
to act in it.”</p>

<p>“Connie ought to be a star,” Millicent remarked,
“she gives a lot of time to theatricals.”</p>

<p>“There’s just a question whether Connie and George
Whitford are not—well, getting up theatricals does
make for intimacy!” said Helen. “I wish George had
less money! An idle man—particularly a fascinating
devil like George—is a dangerous playmate for a
woman like Connie!”</p>

<p>“Oh, but Connie’s a dear!” exclaimed Millicent defensively.
“Her position isn’t easy. A lot of the
criticism you hear of her is unjust.”</p>

<p>“A lot of the criticism you hear of everybody is
unjust,” Bruce ventured.</p>

<p>“Oh, we have a few people here who pass for respectable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[289]</span>
but start all the malicious gossip in town,”
Helen observed. “They’re not all women, either! I
suspect Mort Walters of spreading the story that Connie
and George are having a big affair, and that Mr.
Mills gave Connie a good combing about it before he
went abroad!”</p>

<p>“Ridiculous!” murmured Millicent.</p>

<p>“Of course,” Helen went on. “We all know why
Leila’s father dragged her away. But Connie ought
really to have a care. It’s too bad Shep isn’t big
enough to give Walters a thrashing. The trouble with
Walters is that he tried to start a little affair with
Connie himself and she turned him down cold. Pardon
me, are we gossiping?”</p>

<p>“Of course not!” laughed Millicent.</p>

<p>“Just whetting our appetites for anything new that
offers at the club,” said Bruce. “I’m glad I’m a new
man in town; I can listen to all the scandal without
being obliged to take sides.”</p>

<p>“Millie! You hate gossip,” said Helen, “so please
talk about the saints so I won’t have a chance to chatter
about the sinners.”</p>

<p>“Don’t worry,” said Bruce. “If there were no sinners
the saints wouldn’t know how good they are!”</p>

<p>“We’d better quit on that,” said Helen. “It’s time
to go!”</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>At the hall where the Dramatic Club’s entertainments
were given they met Shepherd Mills, who confessed
that he had been holding four seats in the hope that
they’d have pity on him and not let him sit alone.</p>

<p>“I’ve hardly seen Connie for a week,” he said. “This<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[290]</span>
thing of having a wife on the stage is certainly hard
on the husband!”</p>

<p>The room was filled to capacity and there were
many out of town guests, whom Shep named proudly
as though their presence were attributable to the fact
that Connie was on the program.</p>

<p>Whitford, in his ample leisure, had been putting new
spirit into the club, and the first two of the one-act
plays that constituted the bill disclosed new talent and
were given with precision and finish. Chief interest,
however, lay in the third item of the bill, a short poetic
drama written by Whitford himself. The scene, revealed
as the curtain rose, was of Whitford’s own
designing—the battlements of a feudal castle, with a
tower rising against a sweep of blue sky. The set
transcended anything that the club had seen in its long
history and was greeted with a quick outburst of applause.
Whitford’s name passed over the room, it
seemed, in a single admiring whisper. George was a
genius; the town had never possessed anyone comparable
to George Whitford, who distinguished himself
alike in war and in the arts of peace and could
afford to spend money with a free hand on amateur
theatricals.</p>

<p>His piece, “The Beggar,” written in blank verse,
was dated vaguely in the Middle Ages and the device
was one of the oldest known to romance. A lord of
high degree is experiencing the time-honored difficulty
in persuading his daughter of the desirability of marriage
with a noble young knight whose suit she has
steadfastly scorned. The castle is threatened; the
knight’s assistance is imperatively needed; and the arrival
of messengers, the anxious concern of the servitors,
induce at once an air of tensity.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[291]</span>In the fading afternoon light Constance Mills, as
the princess, who has been wandering in the gardens,
makes her entrance unconcernedly and greets her distracted
lover with light-hearted indifference. She begins
recounting a meeting with a beggar minstrel who
has beguiled her with his music. She provokingly insists
upon singing snatches of his songs to the irritated
knight, who grows increasingly uneasy over the danger
to the beleagured castle. As the princess exits the
beggar appears and engages the knight in a colloquy,
witty and good-humored on the vagrant’s part, but
marked by the knight’s mounting anger. Whitford,
handsome, jaunty, assured, even in his rags, with his
shrewd retorts evokes continuous laughter.</p>

<p>A renewed alarm calls the knight away, leaving the
beggar thrumming his lute. The princess reappears
to the dimming of lights and the twinkle in the blue
background of the first tremulous star. The beggar,
who of course is the enemy prince in disguise, springs
forward as she slips out of her cloak and stands forth
in a flowing robe in shimmering white. Her interchange
with the beggar passes swiftly from surprise,
indifference, scorn, to awakened interest and encouragement.</p>

<p>No theatre was ever stilled to an intenser silence.
The audacity of it, the folly of it! The pictorial
beauty of the scene, any merit it possessed as drama,
were lost in the fact that George Whitford was making
love to Constance Mills. No make-believe could have
simulated the passion of his wooing in the lines that
he had written for himself, and no response could have
been informed with more tenderness and charm than
Constance brought to her part.</p>

<p>Whitford was declaiming:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[292]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="indent">“My flower! My light, my life! I offer thee</div>
<div class="verse">Not jingling coin, nor lands, nor palaces,</div>
<div class="verse">But yonder stars, and the young moon of spring,</div>
<div class="verse">And rosy dawns and purple twilights long;</div>
<div class="verse">All singing streams, and their great lord the sea—</div>
<div class="verse">With these I’d thee endow.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>And Constance, slowly lifting her head, an enthralling
picture of young trusting love, replied:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="indent">“I am a beggar in my heart!</div>
<div class="verse">My soul hath need of thee! Teach me thy ways,</div>
<div class="verse">And make me partner in thy wanderings,</div>
<div class="verse">And lead me to the silver springs of song,</div>
<div class="verse">I would be free as thou art, roam the world,</div>
<div class="verse">Away from clanging war, by murmuring streams,</div>
<div class="verse">Through green cool woodlands sweet with peace and love....</div>
<div class="verse">Wilt thou be faithful, wilt thou love me long?”</div>
</div></div>

<p>To her tremulous pleading he pledged his fealty
and when he had taken her into his arms and kissed
her they exited slowly. As they passed from sight his
voice was heard singing as the curtain fell.</p>

<p>The entire cast paraded in response to the vociferous
and long continued applause, and Whitford and
Constance bowed their acknowledgments together and
singly. Cries of “author” detained Whitford for a
speech, in which he chaffed himself and promised that
in appreciation of their forbearance in allowing him to
present so unworthy a trifle, which derived its only
value from the intelligence and talent of his associates,
he would never again tax their patience.</p>

<p>As the lights went up Bruce, turning to his companions,
saw that Shepherd was staring at the stage
as though the players were still visible. Helen, too,
noticed the tense look in Shep’s face, and touched him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[293]</span>
lightly on the arm. He came to with a start and looked
about quickly, as if conscious that his deep preoccupation
had been observed.</p>

<p>“It was perfectly marvelous, Shep! Connie was
never so beautiful, and she did her part wonderfully!”</p>

<p>“Yes; Connie was fine! They were all splendid!”
Shep stammered.</p>

<p>“I’ve seen her in plays before, but nothing to match
tonight,” said Helen. “You’ll share her congratulations—it’s
a big night for the family!”</p>

<p>They had all risen, and Millicent and Bruce added
their congratulations—Shep smiling but still a little
dazed, his eyes showing that he was thinking back—trying
to remember, in the way of one who has passed
through an ordeal too swiftly for the memory fully to
record it.</p>

<p>“Constance was perfectly adorable!” said Millicent
sincerely.</p>

<p>“Yes, yes!” Shep exclaimed. “I had no idea, really.
She has acting talent, hasn’t she?”</p>

<p>The question was not perfunctory; he was eager for
their assurance that they had been watching a clever
piece of acting.</p>

<p>The room was being cleared for the dancing, and
others near by were expressing their admiration for
his wife. Helen seized a moment to whisper to
Bruce:</p>

<p>“It rather knocked him. Be careful that he doesn’t
run away. George ought to be shot—Heaven knows
there’s been enough talk already!”</p>

<p>“The only trouble is that they were a little too good,
that’s all,” said Bruce. “That oughtn’t to be a sin—when
you remember what amateur shows usually are!”</p>

<p>“It’s not to laugh!” Helen replied. “Shep’s terribly
sensitive! He’s not so stupid but he saw that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[294]</span>
George was enjoying himself making love to Connie.”</p>

<p>“Well, who wouldn’t enjoy it!” Bruce answered.</p>

<p>The dancing had begun when Constance appeared
on the floor. She had achieved a triumph and it may
have been that she was just a little frightened now
that it was over. As she held court near the stage,
smilingly receiving congratulations, she waved to Shep
across the crowd.</p>

<p>“Was I so very bad?” she asked Bruce. “I was
terribly nervous for fear I’d forget my lines.”</p>

<p>“But you didn’t! It was the most enthralling half hour
I ever spent. I’m proud to know you!”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Bruce. Do something for me. These
people bore me; tell Shep to come and dance with me.
Yes—with you afterwards.”</p>

<p>Whether it was kindness or contrition that prompted
this request did not matter. It sufficed that Connie
gave her first dance to Shep and that they glided over
the floor with every appearance of blissful happiness.
Whitford was passing about, paying particular attention
to the mothers of debutantes, quite as unconcernedly
as though he had not given the club its greatest
thrill....</p>

<p>As this was Millicent’s first appearance since her
election to the club, her sponsors were taking care that
she met such of the members as had not previously
been within her social range. Franklin Mills’s efforts
to establish the Hardens had not been unavailing.
Bruce, watching her as she danced with a succession
of partners, heard an elderly army officer asking the
name of the golden-haired girl who carried herself so
superbly.</p>

<p>Bruce was waiting for his next dance with her and
not greatly interested in what went on about him,
when Dale Freeman accosted him.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[295]</span>“Just look at the girl! Seeing her dancing just like
any other perfectly healthy young being, you’d never
think she had so many wonderful things in her head
and heart. Millie’s one of those people who think with
their hearts as well as their brains. When you find
that combination, sonny, you’ve got something!”</p>

<p>“Um—yes,” he assented glumly.</p>

<p>Dale looked up at him and laughed. “I’ll begin to
suspect you’re in love with her now if you act like
this!”</p>

<p>“The suspicion does me honor!” he replied.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m not going to push you! I did have some
idea of helping you, but I see it’s no use.”</p>

<p>“Really, none,” he answered soberly. And for a
moment the old unhappiness clutched him....</p>

<p>At one o’clock he left the hall with Helen and
Millicent.</p>

<p>“I suppose the tongues will wag for a while,” Helen
sighed wearily. “But you’ve got to hand it to Constance
and George! They certainly put on a good
show!”</p>

<p>At the Harden’s Bruce took Millicent’s key and unlocked
the door.</p>

<p>“I’ve enjoyed this; it’s been fine,” she said and
put out her hand.</p>

<p>“It was a pretty full evening,” he replied. “But
there’s a part of it I’ve stored away as better than the
plays—even better than my dances with you!”</p>

<p>“I know!” she said. “Helen’s salad!”</p>

<p>“Oh, better even than that! The talk at the table—your
talk! I must thank you for that!”</p>

<p>“Oh, please forget! I believe I’d rather you’d remember
our last dance!”</p>

<p>She laughed light-heartedly and the door closed.</p>

<p>“They’ve done it now!” exclaimed Helen as the car<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[296]</span>
rolled on. “Why will people be such fools! To think
they had to go and let the whole town into the secret!”</p>

<p>“Cease worrying! If they’d really cared anything
for each other they couldn’t have done it.”</p>

<p>“George would—it was just the dare-devil sort of
thing that George Whitford <i>would</i> do!”</p>

<p>“Well, you’re not troubled about me any more!” he
laughed. “A little while ago you thought Connie had
designs on me! Has it got to be someone?”</p>

<p>“That’s exactly it! It’s got to be someone with
Connie!”</p>

<p>But when he had left her and was driving on to his
apartment it was of Millicent he thought, not of Constance
and Whitford. It was astonishing how much
freer he felt now that the Atlantic rolled between him
and Franklin Mills.</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>Bruce, deeply engrossed in his work, was nevertheless
aware that the performance of “The Beggar”
had stimulated gossip about Constance Mills and Whitford.
Helen Torrence continued to fret about it; Bud
Henderson insisted on keeping Bruce apprised of it;
Maybelle deplored and Dale Freeman pretended to
ignore. The provincial mind must have exercise, and
Bruce was both amused and disgusted as he found
that the joint appearance of Constance and Whitford
in Whitford’s one-act play had caused no little perturbation
in minds that lacked nobler occupation or
were incapable of any very serious thought about
anything.</p>

<p>It had become a joke at the University Club that
Bruce, who was looked upon as an industrious young<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[297]</span>
man, gave so much time to Shepherd Mills. There
was a doglike fidelity in Shep’s devotion that would
have been amusing if it hadn’t been pathetic. Bud
Henderson said that Shep trotted around after Bruce
like a lame fox terrier that had attached itself to an
Airedale for protection.</p>

<p>Shep, inspired perhaps by Bruce’s example, or to
have an excuse for meeting him, had taken up handball.
As the winter wore on this brought them together
once or twice a week at the Athletic Club. One
afternoon in March they had played their game and
had their shower and were in the locker room dressing.</p>

<p>Two other men came in a few minutes later and,
concealed by the lockers, began talking in low tones.
Their voices rose until they were audible over half
the room. Bruce began to hear names—first Whitford’s,
then unmistakably Constance Mills was referred
to. Shep raised his head as he caught his wife’s name.
One of the voices was unmistakably that of Morton
Walters, a young man with an unpleasant reputation
as a gossip. Bruce dropped a shoe to warn the men
that they were not alone in the room. But Walters
continued, and in a moment a harsh laugh preluded the
remark:</p>

<p>“Well, George takes his pleasure where he finds it.
But if I were Shep Mills I certainly wouldn’t stand
for it!”</p>

<p>Shep jumped up and started for the aisle, but Bruce
stepped in front of him and walked round to where
Walters and a friend Bruce didn’t know were standing
before their lockers.</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon, Mr. Walters, but may I remind
you that this is a gentleman’s club?”</p>

<p>“Well, no; you may not!” Walters retorted hotly.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[298]</span>
He advanced toward Bruce, his eyes blazing wrathfully.</p>

<p>The men, half clothed, eyed each other for a moment.</p>

<p>“We don’t speak of women in this club as you’ve
been doing,” said Bruce. “I’m merely asking you to
be a little more careful.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you’re criticizing my manners, are you?” flared
Walters.</p>

<p>“Yes; that’s what I’m doing. They’re offensive.
My opinion of you is that you’re a contemptible blackguard!”</p>

<p>“Then that for your opinion!”</p>

<p>Walters sprang forward and dealt Bruce a ringing
slap in the face. Instantly both had their fists up.
Walters’s companion grasped him by the arm, begging
him to be quiet, but he flung him off and moved toward
Bruce aggressively.</p>

<p>They sparred for a moment warily; then Walters
landed a blow on Bruce’s shoulder.</p>

<p>“So you’re Mrs. Mills’s champion, are you?” he
sneered.</p>

<p>Intent upon the effect of his words, he dropped his
guard. With lightning swiftness Bruce feinted,
slapped his adversary squarely across the mouth and
followed with a cracking blow on the jaw that sent
him toppling over the bench. His fall made considerable
noise, and the superintendent of the club came
running in to learn the cause of the disturbance. Walters,
quickly on his feet, was now struggling to shake
off his friend. Several other men coming in stopped
in the aisle and began chaffing Walters, thinking that
he and Bruce were engaged in a playful scuffle. Walters,
furious that his friend wouldn’t release him, began
cursing loudly.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[299]</span>“Gentlemen, this won’t do!” the superintendent admonished.
“We can’t have this here!”</p>

<p>“Mr. Walters,” said Bruce when Walters had been
forced to sit down, “if you take my advice you’ll be
much more careful of your speech. If you want my
address you’ll find it in the office!”</p>

<p>He went back to Shep, who sat huddled on the bench
by his locker, his face in his hands. He got up at once
and they finished dressing in silence. Walters made no
further sign, though he could be heard blustering to his
companion while the superintendent hovered about to
preserve the peace.</p>

<p>Shep’s limousine was waiting—he made a point of
delivering Bruce wherever he might be going after
their meetings at the club—and he got into it and sat
silent until his house was reached. He hadn’t uttered
a word; the life seemed to have gone out of him.</p>

<p>Bruce walked with him to the door and said “Good
night, Shep,” as though nothing had happened. Shep
rallied sufficiently to repeat the good-night, choking
and stammering upon it. Bruce returned to the machine
and bade the chauffeur take him home.</p>

<p>He did no work that night. Viewed from any
angle, the episode was disagreeable. Walters would
continue to talk—no doubt with increased viciousness.
Bruce wasn’t sorry he had struck him, but as he thought
it over he found that the only satisfaction he derived
from the episode was a sense that it was for Shep that
he had taken Walters to task. Poor Shep! Bruce
wished that he did not so constantly think of Shep in
commiserative phrases....</p>

<p>Bud Henderson, who was in the club when the row
occurred, informed Bruce that the men who had been
in the locker room were good fellows and that the story
was not likely to spread. It was a pity, though, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[300]</span>
Bud’s view, that the thing had to be smothered, for
Walters had been entitled to a licking for some time
and the occurrence would make Bruce the most popular
man in town.</p>

<p>“If the poor boob had known how you used to train
with that middle-weight champ in Boston during our
bright college years he wouldn’t have slapped you!
I’ll bet his jaw’s sore!”</p>

<p>Bruce was not consoled. He wished the world would
behave itself; and in particular he wished that he was
not so constantly, so inevitably, as it seemed, put into
the position of aiding and defending the house of
Mills.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER NINETEEN</h2>
</div>


<h3>I</h3>

<p>Bruce worked at his plans for the Laconia memorial
determinedly and, he hoped, with inspiration. He
looked in at the Hardens’ on a Sunday afternoon and
found Millicent entertaining several callow youths—new
acquaintances whom she had met at the functions
to which Mills’s cautious but effective propaganda had
admitted her. Bruce did not remain long; he thought
Millicent was amused by his poorly concealed disappointment
at not finding her alone. But he was deriving
little satisfaction from his self-denial in remaining
away and grew desperate for a talk with her. He made
his next venture on a wild March night, and broke
forth in a pæan of thanksgiving when he found her
alone in the library.</p>

<p>“You were deliciously funny when you found me
surrounded! Those were nice boys; they’d just discovered
me!”</p>

<p>“They had the look of determined young fiends!
I knew I couldn’t stay them out. But I dare ’em to leave
home on a night like this!”</p>

<p>“Oh, I know! You’re afraid of competition! After
you left that Sunday mamma brought in ginger
cookies and we popped corn and had a grand old time!”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[302]</span>“It sounds exciting. But it was food for the spirit I
needed; I couldn’t have stood it to see them eat!”</p>

<p>“Just for that our pantry is closed to you forever—never
a cookie! Those boys were vastly pleased to
meet you. They knew you as a soldier of the
Republic and a crack handball player—not as an eminent
architect. That for fame! By the way, you must
be up to something mysterious. Dale gave me just a
tiny hint that you’re working on something prodigious.
But of course I don’t ask to be let into the secret!”</p>

<p>“The secret’s permanent if I fail!” he laughed.</p>

<p>He was conscious that their acquaintance had progressed
in spite of their rare meetings. Tonight she
played for him and talked occasionally from the organ—running
comment on some liturgical music with
which she had lately been familiarizing herself. Presently
he found himself standing beside her; there
seemed nothing strange in this—to be standing where
he could watch her hands and know the thrill of her
smile as she invited his appreciation of some passage
that she was particularly enjoying....</p>

<p>“What have you been doing with your sculpting?
Please bring me up to date on everything,” he said.</p>

<p>“Oh, not so much lately. You might like to see
some children’s heads I’ve been doing. I bring some
of the little convalescents to the house from the hospital
to give them a change.”</p>

<p>“Lucky kids!” he said. “To be brought here and
played with.”</p>

<p>“Why not? They’re entitled to all I have as much
as I am.”</p>

<p>“Revolutionist! Really, Millicent, you must be
careful!”</p>

<p>Yes; no matter how little he saw of her, their amity
and concord strengthened. Sometimes she looked at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[303]</span>
him in a way that quickened his heartbeat. As they
went down from the organ his hand touched hers and
he thrilled at the fleeting contact. A high privilege,
this, to be near her, to be admitted to the sanctuary of
her mind and heart. She had her clichés; harmony was
a word she used frequently, and colors and musical
terms she employed with odd little meanings of her own.</p>

<p>In the studio she showed him a plaque of her mother’s
head which he knew to be creditable work. His praise
of it pleased her. She had none of the amateur’s simpering
affectation and false modesty. She said frankly
she thought it the best thing she had done.</p>

<p>“I know mamma—all her expressions—and that
makes a difference. You’ve got to see under the flesh—get
the inner light even in clay. I might really get
somewhere if I gave up everything else,” she said pensively
as they idled about the studio.</p>

<p>“Yes; you could go far. Why not?”</p>

<p>“Oh, but I’d have to give up too much. I like life—being
among people; and I have my father and mother.
I think I’ll go on just as I am. If I got too serious
about it I might be less good than now, when I merely
play at it....”</p>

<p>In their new familiarity he made bold to lift the
coverings of some of her work that she thought unworthy
of display. She became gay over some of her
failures, as she called them. She didn’t throw them
away because they kept her humble.</p>

<p>On a table in a corner of the room stood a bust covered
with a cloth to which they came last.</p>

<p>“Another <i>magnum opus</i>?” he asked carelessly.
She lifted the cloth and stood away from it.</p>

<p>“Mr. Mills gave me some sittings. But this is my
greatest fizzle of all; I simply couldn’t get him!”</p>

<p>The features of Franklin Mills had been reproduced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[304]</span>
in the clay with mechanical fidelity; but unquestionably
something was lacking. Bruce studied it seriously,
puzzled by its deficiencies.</p>

<p>“Maybe you can tell me what’s wrong,” she said.
“It’s curious that a thing can come so close and fail.”</p>

<p>“It’s a true thing,” remarked Bruce, “as far as it
goes. But you’re right; there’s something that isn’t
there. If you don’t mind, it’s dead—there’s—there’s
no life in it.”</p>

<p>Millicent touched the clay here and there, suggesting
points where the difficulty might lie. She was so
intent that she failed to see the changing expression
on Bruce’s face. He had ceased to think of the clay
image. Mills himself had been in the studio, probably
many times. The thought of this stirred the jealousy
in Bruce’s heart—Millicent and Mills! Every kind
and generous thought he had ever entertained for the
man was obliterated by this evidence that for many
hours he had been there with Millicent. But she, understanding
nothing of this, was startled when he flung
round at her.</p>

<p>“I think I can tell you what’s the matter,” he said
in a tone harsh and strained. “The fault’s not yours!”</p>

<p>“No?” she questioned wonderingly.</p>

<p>“The man has no soul,” he said, as though he were
pronouncing sentence of death.</p>

<p>That Millicent should have fashioned this counterfeit
of Mills, animated perhaps by an interest that
might quicken to love, was intolerable. Passion possessed
him. Lifting the bust, he flung it with a loud
crash upon the tile floor. He stared dully at the scattered
fragments.</p>

<p>“God!” he turned toward her with the hunger of
love in his eyes. “I—I—I’m sorry—I didn’t mean
to do that!”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[305]</span>He caught her hand roughly; gently released it, and
ran up the steps into the library.</p>

<p>Millicent remained quite still till the outer door had
closed upon him. She looked down at the broken
pieces of the bust, trying to relate them to the cause
of his sudden wrath. Then she knelt and began mechanically,
patiently, picking up the fragments. Suddenly
she paused. Her hands relaxed and the bits of
clay fell to the floor. She stood up, her figure tense,
her head lifted, and a light came into her eyes.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>He had made a fool of himself: this was Bruce’s
reaction to the sudden fury that had caused him
to destroy Millicent’s bust of Franklin Mills. He
would never dare go near her again; and having thus
fixed his own punishment, and being very unhappy
about it, a spiteful fate ordained that he should meet
her early the next morning in the lobby of the Central
States Trust Company, where, out of friendly regard
for Shepherd Mills, he had opened an account.</p>

<p>“So—I’m not the only early riser!” she exclaimed,
turning away from one of the teller’s windows as he
passed. “This is pay day at home and I’m getting
the cook’s money. I walked down—what a glorious
morning!”</p>

<p>“Cook—money?” he repeated stupidly. There was
nothing extraordinary in the idea that she should be
drawing the domestic payroll. Her unconcern, the
deftness with which she snapped her purse upon a roll
of new bills and dropped it into a bead bag were disconcerting.
Her eyes turned toward the door and he
must say something. She was enchanting in her gray
fur coat and feathered hat of vivid blue; it hadn’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[306]</span>
been necessary for her to say that she had walked four
miles from her house to the bank; her glowing cheeks
were an eloquent advertisement of that.</p>

<p>“Please,” he began eagerly. “About last night—I
made a dreadful exhibition of myself. I know—I
mean that to beg your forgiveness——”</p>

<p>“Is wholly unnecessary!” she finished smilingly.
“The bust was a failure and I had meant to destroy
it myself. So please forget it!”</p>

<p>“But my bad manners!”</p>

<p>She was making it too easy for his comfort. He
wished to abase himself, to convince her of his contrition.</p>

<p>“Well,” she said with a judicial air, “generally speaking,
I approve of your manners. We all have our
careless moments. I’ve been guilty myself of upsetting
bric-a-brac that I got tired of seeing in the house.”</p>

<p>“You ought to scold me—cut my acquaintance.”</p>

<p>“Who’d be punished then?” she demanded, drawing
the fur collar closer about her throat.</p>

<p>“I might die!” he moaned plaintively.</p>

<p>“An irreparable loss—to the world!” she said, “for
which I refuse to become responsible.” She took a step
toward the door and paused. “If I may refer to your
destructive habits, I’ll say you’re some critic!” She
left him speculating as to her meaning. To outward
appearances, at least, she hadn’t been greatly disturbed
by the smashing of Mills’s image.</p>

<p>When he had concluded his errand he went to the
enclosure where the company’s officers sat to speak to
Shep, whom he had been avoiding since the encounter
with Walters at the Athletic Club. Shep jumped up
and led the way to the directors’ room.</p>

<p>“You know,” he began, “I don’t want to seem to be
pursuing you, but”—he was stammering and his fine,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[307]</span>
frank eyes opened and shut quickly in his agitation—“but
you’ve got to know how much I appreciate——”</p>

<p>“Now, old man,” Bruce interrupted, laying his hand
on Shep’s shoulder, “let’s not talk of ancient history.”</p>

<p>Shep shook his head impatiently.</p>

<p>“No, by George! You’ve <i>got</i> to take my thanks!
It was bully of you to punch that scoundrel’s head. I
ought to have done it myself, but——” He held out
his arms, his eyes measuring his height against Bruce’s
tall frame, and grinned ruefully.</p>

<p>“I didn’t give you a chance, Shep,” said Bruce,
drawing himself onto the table and swinging his legs
at ease. “I don’t believe that bird’s been looking for
me; I’ve been right here in town.”</p>

<p>“I guess he won’t bother you much!” exclaimed Shep
with boyish pride in his champion’s prowess. “You
certainly gave him a good one!”</p>

<p>“He seemed to want it,” replied Bruce. “I couldn’t
just kiss him after he slapped me!”</p>

<p>“I told Connie! I didn’t care for what Walters said—you
understand—but I wanted Connie to know what
you did—for her!”</p>

<p>His eyes appealed for Bruce’s understanding. But
Bruce, who had hoped that Shep wouldn’t tell Connie,
now wished heartily that Shep would drop the matter.</p>

<p>“You made too much of it! It wasn’t really for
anyone in particular that I gave Walters that little
tap—it was to assert a general principle of human
conduct.”</p>

<p>“We’ll never forget it,” declared Shep, not to be
thwarted in his expression of gratitude. “That anyone
should speak of Connie—<i>Connie</i>—in that fashion!
Why, Connie’s the noblest girl in the world! You
know that, the whole world knows it!”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[308]</span>He drew back and straightened his shoulders as
though daring the world to gainsay him.</p>

<p>“Why, of course, Shep!” Bruce replied quietly. He
drew a memorandum from his pocket and asked about
some bonds the trust company had advertised and into
which he considered converting some of the securities
he had left with his banker at Laconia which were
now maturing. Shep, pleased that Bruce was inviting
his advice in the matter, produced data from the archives
in confirmation of his assurance that the bonds
were gilt-edge and a desirable investment. Bruce
lingered, spending more time than was necessary in
discussing the matter merely to divert Shep’s thoughts
from the Walters’ episode.</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>Bruce had never before worked so hard; Freeman
said that the designer of the Parthenon had been a
loafer in comparison. After a long and laborious day
he would drive to the Freemans with questions about
his designs for the memorial that he feared to sleep
on. Dale remarked to her husband that it was inspiring
to see a young man of Bruce’s fine talent and enthusiasm
engrossed upon a task and at the same time
in love—an invincible combination.</p>

<p>Carroll had kept in mind the visit to Laconia he had
proposed and they made a week-end excursion of it
in May. Bruce was glad of the chance to inspect the
site of the memorial, and happier than he had expected
to be in meeting old friends. It was disclosed
that Carroll’s interest in Bruce’s cousin was not quite
so incidental as he had pretended. Mills’s secretary
had within the year several times visited Laconia, an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[309]</span>
indication that he was not breaking his heart over
Leila.</p>

<p>Bruce stole away from the hotel on Sunday morning
to visit his mother’s grave. She had lived so constantly
in his thoughts that it seemed strange that she
could be lying in the quiet cemetery beside John Storrs.
There was something of greatness in her or she would
never have risked the loss of his respect and affection.
She had trusted him, confident of his magnanimity
and love. Strange that in that small town, with its
brave little flourish of prosperity, she had lived all
those years with that secret in her heart, perhaps with
that old passion tormenting her to the end. She had
not been afraid of him, had not feared that he would
despise her. “O soul of fire within a woman’s clay”—this
line from a fugitive poem he had chanced upon
in a newspaper expressed her. On his way into town
he passed the old home, resenting the presence of the
new owner, who could not know what manner of
woman had dwelt there, sanctified its walls, given
grace to the garden where the sun-dial and the flower
beds still spoke of her.... Millicent was like Marian.
Very precious had grown this thought, of the spiritual
kinship of his mother and Millicent.</p>

<p>Traversing the uneven brick pavements along the
maple arched street, it was in his mind that his mother
and Millicent would have understood each other. They
dreamed the same dreams; the garden walls had not
shut out Marian Storrs’s vision of the infinite. A
church bell whose clamorous peal was one of his earliest
recollections seemed subdued today to a less insistent
note by the sweetness of the spring air. Old
memories awoke. He remembered a sermon he had
heard in the church of the sonorous bell when he was
still a child; the fear it had wakened in his heart—a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[310]</span>
long noisy discourse on the penalties of sin, the horror
in store for the damned. And he recalled how his
mother had taken his hand and smiled down at him
there in the Storrs pew—that adorable smile of hers.
And that evening as they sat alone in the garden on
the bench by the sun-dial she had comforted him and
told him that God—her God—was not the frightful
being the visiting minister had pictured, but generous
and loving. Yes, Millicent was like Marian Storrs....</p>

<p>After this holiday he fell upon his work with renewed
energy—but he saw Millicent frequently. It
was much easier to pass through the Harden gate and
ring the bell now that the windows of the Mills house
were boarded up. Mrs. Harden and the doctor made
clear their friendliness—not with parental anxiety to
ingratiate themselves with an eligible young man, but
out of sincere regard and liking.</p>

<p>“You were raised in a country town and all us folks
who were brought up in small towns speak the same
language,” Mrs. Harden declared. She conferred the
highest degree of her approval by receiving him in
the kitchen on the cook’s day out, when she could, in her
own phrase, putter around all she pleased. Millicent,
enchantingly aproned, shared in the sacred rites of preparing
the evening meal on these days of freedom, when
there was very likely to be beaten biscuit, in the preparation
of which Bruce was duly initiated.</p>

<p>Spring repeated its ancient miracle in the land of the
tall corn. A pleasant haven for warm evenings was the
Harden’s “back yard” as the Doctor called it, though it
was the most artistic garden in town, where Mrs.
Harden indulged her taste in old-fashioned flowers;
and there was a tea house set in among towering
forest trees where Millicent held court. Bruce appearing
late, with the excuse that he had been at work,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[311]</span>
was able to witness the departure of Millicent’s other
“company” as her parents designated her visitors, and
enjoy an hour with her alone. Their privacy was invaded
usually by Mrs. Harden, who appeared with a
pitcher of cooling drink and plates of the cakes in
which she specialized. She was enormously busy with
her work on the orphan asylum board. She was ruining
the orphans, the Doctor said; but he was proud
of his wife and encouraged her philanthropies. He
was building a hospital in his home town—thus, according
to Bud Henderson, propitiating the gods for
the enormity of his offense against medical ethics in
waxing rich off the asthma cure. The Doctor’s sole
recreation was fishing; he had found a retired minister,
also linked in some way with the Hardens’ home
town, who shared his weakness. They frequently rose
with the sun and drove in Harden’s car to places where
they had fished as boys. Bruce had known people like
the Hardens at Laconia. Even in the big handsome
house they retained their simplicity, a simplicity which
in some degree explained Millicent. It was this quality
in her that accounted for much—the sincerity and artlessness
with which she expressed beliefs that gained
sanctity from her very manner of speaking of them.</p>

<p>On a June night he put into the mail his plans for
the memorial and then drove to the Hardens’. Millicent
had been playing for some callers who were just
leaving.</p>

<p>“If you’re not afraid of being moonstruck, let’s sit
out of doors,” she suggested.</p>

<p>“It’s a habit—this winding up my day here! I’ve
just finished a little job and laid it tenderly on the
knees of the gods.”</p>

<p>“Ah, the mysterious job is done! Is it anything
that might be assisted by a friendly thought?”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[312]</span>“Just a bunch of papers in the mail; that’s all.”</p>

<p>They talked listlessly, in keeping with the langurous
spirit of the night. The Mills house was plainly visible
through the shrubbery. In his complete relaxation,
his contentment at being near Millicent, Bruce’s
thoughts traveled far afield while he murmured assent
to what she was saying. The moonlit garden, its serenity
hardly disturbed by the occasional whirr of a
motor in the boulevard, invited to meditation, and
Millicent was speaking almost as though she were
thinking aloud in her musical voice that never lost its
charm for him.</p>

<p>“It’s easy to believe all manner of strange things
on a night like this! I can even imagine that I was
someone else once upon a time....”</p>

<p>“Go right on!” he said, rousing himself, ready for
the game which they often played like two children.
He turned to face her. “I have a sneaking idea that
a thousand years ago at this minute I was sitting
peacefully by a well in an oasis with camels and horses
and strange dark men sleeping round me; that same
lady moon looking down on the scene, making the
sandy waste look like a field of snow.”</p>

<p>“That sounds dusty and hot! Now me—I’m on a
galley ship driving through the night; a brisk cool
wind is blowing; a slave is singing a plaintive song
and the captain of the rowers is thumping time for
them to row by and the moon is shining down on an
island just ahead. It’s all very jolly! We’re off the
coast of Greece somewhere, I think.”</p>

<p>“I suppose that being on a ship while I’m away
off in a desert I really shouldn’t be talking to you. I
couldn’t take my camel on your yacht!”</p>

<p>“There’s telepathy,” she suggested.</p>

<p>“Thanks for the idea! If we’ve arrived in this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[313]</span>
pleasant garden after a thousand-year journey I certainly
shan’t complain!”</p>

<p>“It wouldn’t profit you much if you did! And besides,
my feelings would be hurt!” she laughed softly.
“I do so love the sound of my own voice—I wonder
if that’s because I’ve been silent a thousand years!”</p>

<p>“I hope you weren’t, for—I admire your voice!
Looking at the stars does make you think large
thoughts. If they had all been flung into space by
chance, as a child scatters sand, we’d have had a badly
scrambled universe by this time—it must be for something—something
pretty important.”</p>

<p>“I wonder....” She bent forward, her elbow on
the arm of the chair, her hand laid against her cheek.
“Let’s pretend we can see all mankind, from the beginning,
following a silken cord that Some One ahead
is unwinding and dropping behind as a guide. And
we all try to hold fast to it—we lose it over and over
again and stumble over those who have fallen in the
dark places of the road—then we clutch it again. And
we never quite see the leader, but we know he is there,
away on ahead trying to guide us to the goal——”</p>

<p>“Yes,” he said eagerly, “the goal——”</p>

<p>“Is happiness! That’s what we’re all searching for!
And our Leader has had so many names—those ahead
are always crying back a name caught from those
ahead of them—down through the ages. But it helps
to know that many are on ahead clutching the cord,
not going too fast for fear the great host behind may
lose their hope and drop the cord altogether!”</p>

<p>“I like that; it’s bully! It’s the life line, the great
clue——”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes,” she said, “and even the half gods are
not to be sneered at; they’ve tangled up the cord and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[314]</span>
tied hard knots in it—— Oh, dear! I’m soaring
again!”</p>

<p>There had been some question of her going away
for the remainder of the summer, and he referred to
this presently. He was hoping that she would go
before the return of Mills and Leila. The old intimacy
between the two houses would revive: it might
be that Millicent was ready to marry Mills; and tonight
Bruce did not doubt his own love for her—if
only he might touch her hand that lay so near and tell
her! In the calm night he felt again the acute loneliness
that had so beset him in his year-long pilgrimage
in search of peace; and he had found at the end a love
that was not peace. After the verdict of the judges of
the memorial plans was given it would be best for him
to leave—go to New York perhaps and try his fortune
there, and forget these months that had been so packed
with experience.</p>

<p>“We’re likely to stay on here indefinitely,” Millicent
was saying. “I’d rather go away in the winter;
the summer is really a joy. A lot of the people we
know are staying at home. Connie and Shep are not
going away, and Dale says she’s not going to budge.
And Helen Torrence keeps putting off half a dozen
flights she’s threatened to take. And Bud and Maybelle
seem content. So why run away from friends?”</p>

<p>“No reason, of course. The corn requires heat and
why should we be superior to the corn?”</p>

<p>“I had a letter from Leila today. She says she’s
perishing to come home!”</p>

<p>“I’ll wager she is!” laughed Bruce. “What’s going
to happen when she comes?”</p>

<p>He picked up his hat and they were slowly crossing
the lawn toward the gate.</p>

<p>“You mean Freddie Thomas.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[315]</span>“I suppose I do mean Fred! But I didn’t mean to
pump you. It’s Leila’s business.”</p>

<p>“I’ll be surprised if a few months’ travel doesn’t
change Leila. She and Freddy had an awful crush
on each other when she left. If she’s still of the
same mind—well, her father may find the trip wasn’t
so beneficial!”</p>

<p>From her tone Bruce judged that Millicent was not
greatly concerned about Leila. She went through the
gates with him to his car at the curb.</p>

<p>“Whatever it is you sent shooting through the night—here’s
good luck to it!” she said as he climbed into
his machine. “Do you suppose that’s the train?”</p>

<p>She raised her hand and bent her head to listen.
The rumble of a heavy train and the faint clang of a
locomotive bell could be heard beyond the quiet residential
neighborhood. He was pleased that she had
remembered, sorry now that he had not told her what
it was that he had committed to the mails. She
snapped her fingers, exclaiming:</p>

<p>“I’ve sent a wish with it, whether it’s to your true
love or whatever it is!”</p>

<p>“It wasn’t a love letter,” he called after her as she
paused under the gate lamps to wave her hand.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER TWENTY</h2>
</div>


<h3>I</h3>

<p>Franklin Mills landed in New York feeling that his
excursion abroad had been well worth while. Leila
had been the cheeriest of companions and Mills felt
that he knew her much better than he had ever known
her before. They had stopped in Paris and he had
cheerfully indulged her extravagance in raiment.
Throughout the trip nothing marred their intercourse.
Mills’s pride and vanity were touched by the admiring
eyes that followed them. In countries where wine and
spirits were everywhere visible Leila betrayed no inclination
to drink, even when he urged some rare vintage
upon her. The child had character; he detected in her
the mental and physical energy, the shrewdness, the
ability to reason, that were a distinguishing feature
of the Mills tradition. Shep hadn’t the swift, penetrating
insight of Leila. Leila caught with a glance
of the eye distinct impressions which Shep would have
missed even with laborious examination. Shep, nevertheless,
was a fine boy; reluctant as he was to acknowledge
an error even to himself, Mills, mellowed by
distance, thought perhaps it had been a mistake to
forbid Shep to study medicine; and yet he had tried
to do the right thing by Shep. It was important for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[317]</span>
the only son of the house of Mills to know the worth
of property.</p>

<p>The only son.... When Mills thought of Shep
and Leila he thought, too, of Storrs—Bruce Storrs
with his undeniable resemblance to Franklin Mills III.
There were times when by some reawakening of old
memories through contact with new scenes—in Venice,
at Sorrento, in motoring into Scotland from the English
lake country—in all places that invited to retrospective
contemplation he lived over again those months
he had spent in Laconia.</p>

<p>Strangely, that period revived with intense vividness.
Released from the routine of his common life,
he indulged his memories, estimating their value, fixing
their place in his life. That episode seemed the
most important of all; he had loved that woman. He
had been a blackguard and a scoundrel; there was no
escaping that, but he could not despise himself. Sometimes
Leila, noting his deep preoccupation on long
motor drives, would tease him to tell her what he was
thinking about and he was hard put to satisfy her that
he hadn’t a care in the world. Once, trying to ease
an attack of homesickness, she led him into speculation
as to what their home-folks were doing—Shep
and Connie, Millicent, and in the same connection she
mentioned Bruce.</p>

<p>“What an awful nice chap he is, Dada. He’s a
prince. You’d know him for a thoroughbred anywhere.
Arthur Carroll says his people were just nice
country town folks—father a lawyer, I think Arthur
said. The Freemans back him strong, and they’re not
people you can fool much.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Storrs is a gentleman,” said Mills. “And a
young man of fine gifts. I’ve had several talks with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[318]</span>
him about his work and ambitions. He’ll make his
mark.”</p>

<p>“He’s good to look at! Millicent says there’s a
Greek-god look about him.”</p>

<p>“Millicent likes him?” asked Mills with an effort at
indifference which did not wholly escape Leila’s vigilant
eye.</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t think it’s more than that. You never
can tell about Millie.”</p>

<p>This was in Edinburgh, shortly before they sailed for
home. All things considered the trip abroad had been
a success. Leila had not to the best of his knowledge
communicated with Thomas—she had made a point
of showing him the letters she received and giving him
her own letters to mail. Very likely, Mills thought,
she had forgotten all about her undesirable suitor, and
as a result of the change of scene and the new amity
established between them, would fulfill her destiny by
marrying Carroll.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>The town house had been opened for their return,
this being a special concession to Leila, who disliked
Deer Trail. Mills yielded graciously, though he enjoyed
Deer Trail more than any other of his possessions;
but there was truth in her complaint that when
he was in town all day, as frequently happened, it was
unbearably lonely unless she fortified herself constantly
with guests.</p>

<p>Mills found all his business interests prospering.
Though Carroll was no longer in the office in the First
National Building, the former secretary still performed
the more important of his old functions in his rôle of
vice-president of the trust company. Mills was not,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[319]</span>
however, to sink into his old comfortable routine without
experiencing a few annoyances and disturbances.
His sister, Mrs. Granville Thornberry, a childless
widow, who had taken a hand in Leila’s upbringing
after Mrs. Mills’s death—an experience that had left
wounds on both sides that had never healed—Mrs.
Thornberry had lingered in town to see him. She had
become involved in a law suit by ignoring Mills’s advice,
and now cheerfully cast upon him the burden of
extricating her from her predicament. The joy of
reminding her that she would have avoided vexatious
and expensive litigation if she had heeded his counsel
hardly mitigated his irritation. But for his sense of
the family dignity he would have declined to have anything
to do with the case.</p>

<p>Carroll had been present at their interview, held in
Mills’s office, and when he left Mrs. Thornberry
lingered. She was tall and slender, quick and incisive
of speech. She absorbed all the local gossip
and in spite of her wealth and status as a Mills was a
good deal feared for her sharp tongue. It was a hot
day and Mills’s patience had been sorely tried by her
seeming inability to grasp the legal questions raised in
the law suit.</p>

<p>“Well, Alice,” he said, with a glance at his desk
clock. “Is there anything else?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Frank; there’s a matter I feel it my duty to
speak of. You know that I never like to interfere in
your affairs. After the trouble we had about Leila I
thought I’d never mention your children to you again.”</p>

<p>“That’s very foolish,” Mills murmured with a slight
frown. He thought she was about to attack Leila and
he had no intention of listening to criticism of Leila.
Alice had made a mess of Leila’s education and he
was not interested in anything she might have to say<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[320]</span>
about her. And Alice was richly endowed with that
heaven-given wisdom as to the rearing of children
which is peculiar to the childless. Mills wished greatly
that Alice would go.</p>

<p>“The matter’s delicate—very delicate, Frank. I
hesitate——”</p>

<p>“Please, Alice!” he interrupted impatiently. “Either
you’ve got something to say or you haven’t!”</p>

<p>At the moment she was not his sister, but a woman
who had precipitated herself into a law suit by giving
an option on a valuable piece of property and then
selling it to a third party, which was stupid and he
hated stupidity. He thought she was probably going
to say that Leila drank too much, but knowing that
Leila had been a pattern of sobriety for months he
was prepared to rebuke her sharply for bringing him
stale gossip.</p>

<p>“It’s about Shep—Shep and Connie!” said Mrs.
Thornberry. “You know how fond I’ve always been
of Shep.”</p>

<p>“Yes—yes,” Mills replied, mystified by this opening.
“Shep’s doing well and I can’t see but he and Connie
are getting on finely. He’s quite surprised me by
the way he’s taken hold in the trust company.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Shep’s a dear. But—there’s talk——”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes; there’s talk!” Mills caught her up.
“There’s always talk about everyone. I even suppose
you and I don’t escape!”</p>

<p>“Well, of course there have been rumors, you know,
Frank, that you are considering marrying again.”</p>

<p>“Oh, they’re trying to marry me, are they?” he
demanded, in a tone that did not wholly discourage
her further confidences.</p>

<p>“I can’t imagine your being so silly. But the impression
is abroad that you’re rather interested in that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">[321]</span>
Harden girl. Ridiculous, of course, at your age!
You’d certainly throw your dignity to the winds if
you married a girl of Leila’s age, whose people are
said to be quite common. They say Dr. Harden used
to travel over the country selling patent medicine from
a wagon at country fairs and places like that.”</p>

<p>“I question the story. The Doctor’s a very agreeable
person, and his wife’s a fine woman. We have
had very pleasant neighborly relations. And Millicent
is an extraordinary girl—mentally the superior
of any girl in town. I’ve been glad of Leila’s intimacy
with her; it’s been for Leila’s good.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I dare say they’re all well enough. Of course
the marriage would be a big card for the Hardens.
You’re a shrewd man, Frank, but it’s just a little too
obvious—what you’ve been doing to push those people
into our own circle. But the girl’s handsome—there’s
no doubt of that.”</p>

<p>“Well, those points are settled, then,” her brother
remarked, taking up the ivory paper cutter and slapping
his palm with it. Alice was never niggardly
with her revelations and he consoled himself with the
reflection that she had shown her full hand.</p>

<p>“This other matter,” Mrs. Thornberry continued
immediately, “is rather more serious. I came back
from California the week after you sailed and I found
a good deal of talk going on about Connie.”</p>

<p>“Connie?” Mills repeated and his fingers tightened
upon the ivory blade.</p>

<p>“Connie’s not behaving herself as a married woman
should. She’s been indulging in a scandalous flirtation—if
that’s not too gentle a name for it—with George
Whitford.”</p>

<p>“Pshaw, Alice! Whitford’s always run with Shep’s
crowd. He’s a sort of fireside pet with all the young<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[322]</span>
married women. George is a fine, manly fellow. I
don’t question that he’s been at Shep’s a good deal.
Shep’s always liked him particularly. And Connie’s
an attractive young woman. Why, George probably
makes love to all the women, old and young, he’s
thrown with for an hour! You’re borrowing trouble
quite unnecessarily, Alice. It’s too bad you have to
hear the gossip that’s always going around here; you
take it much too seriously.”</p>

<p>“It’s not I who take it seriously; it’s common talk!
Shep, poor boy, is so innocent and unsuspecting!
George hasn’t a thing to do but fool at his writing.
He and Connie have been seen a trifle too often on
long excursions to other towns when Shep, no doubt,
thought she was golfing. What I’m telling you is
gossip, of course; I couldn’t prove anything. But it’s
possible sometimes that just a word will save trouble.
You must acquit me of any wish to be meddlesome. I
like Connie; I’ve always tried to like her for Shep’s
sake.”</p>

<p>She was probably not magnifying the extent to which
talk about his son’s wife had gone. His old antagonism
to Constance, the remembrance of his painful
scenes with Shep in his efforts to prevent his marriage,
were once more resurgent. Mrs. Thornberry related
the episode of the dramatic club play which had, from
her story, crystalized and stimulated the tales that had
previously been afloat as to Connie’s interest in Whitford.
Mills promptly seized upon this to dismiss the
whole thing. Things had certainly come to a fine pass
when participation in amateur theatricals could give
rise to scandal; it merely showed the paucity of substantial
material.</p>

<p>He was at pains to conceal his chagrin. His pride
took refuge behind its fortifications; he would not have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">[323]</span>
his sister, of all persons, suspect that he could be
affected by even the mildest insinuation against anyone
invested with the sanctity of the Mills name. He
told her of having met some old friends of hers in
London as he accompanied her to the elevator. But
when he regained his room he stood for some time by
the window gazing across the town to the blue hills.
The patriarchial sense was strong in him; he was the
head and master of his house and he would tolerate
no scandalous conduct on the part of his daughter-in-law.
But he must move cautiously. The Whitfords
were an old family and he had known George’s father
very well. With disagreeable insistence the remembrance
of his adventure in Laconia came back to him.</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>Several weeks passed in which Mills exercised a discreet
vigilance in observing Shep and Connie. Whitford
was in town; Mills met him once and again at
Shep’s house, but there were others of the younger element
present and there was nothing in Whitford’s
conduct to support Mrs. Thornberry’s story. He asked
Carroll incidentally about the dramatic club play—as if
merely curious as to whether it had been a successful
evening, and Carroll’s description of Whitford’s little
drama and of Connie’s part in it was void of any hint
that it concealed a serious attachment between the chief
actors.</p>

<p>The usual social routine of the summer stay-at-homes
was progressing in the familiar lazy fashion—country
club dances, motor trips, picnics and the like.
On his return Mills had called at once upon the Hardens.
Millicent’s charms had in nowise diminished in
his absence. With everything else satisfactorily determined,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">[324]</span>
there would be no reason why he should not
marry Millicent. His sister’s disapproval did not weigh
with him at all. But first he must see Leila married,
and he still hoped to have Carroll for a son-in-law.
Leila had entered into the summer gaieties with her
usual zest, accepting the escort of one and another
available young man with a new amiability. One evening
at the Faraway Country Club Mills saw her dancing
with Thomas; but it was for one dance only, and
Thomas seemed to be distributing his attentions impartially.
A few nights later when they had dined
alone at Deer Trail—Leila had suggested that they go
there merely to please him—as they sat on the veranda
all his hopes that her infatuation for Thomas had passed
were rudely shattered.</p>

<p>“Well, Dada,” she began, when he was half through
his after-dinner cigar, “it’s nice to be back. It’s a lot
more fun being at home in summer. There is something
about the old home town and our own country.
I guess I’m a pretty good little American.”</p>

<p>“I guess you are,” he assented with a chuckle that
expressed his entire satisfaction with her. The veranda
was swept fitfully by a breeze warm sweet
with the breath of ripening corn. It was something
to be owner of some part of the earth; it was good to
be alive, master of himself, able to direct and guide
the lives of others less fortunately endowed than he
with wisdom and power.</p>

<p>Leila touched his hand and he clasped and held it
on the broad arm of his favorite rocker.</p>

<p>“Dada, what a wonderful time we had on our trip!
I was a good little girl—wasn’t I? You know I was
trying so hard to be good!”</p>

<p>“You were an angel,” he exclaimed heartily. “Our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">[325]</span>
trip will always be one of the happiest memories of my
life.”</p>

<p>At once apprehensive, he hoped these approaches
concealed nothing more serious than a request for an
increase in her allowance or perhaps a new car.</p>

<p>“I want to speak about Freddy Thomas,” she said,
freeing her hand and moving her chair the better to
command his attention.</p>

<p>“Thomas!” he said as though repeating an unfamiliar
name. “I thought you were all done with him.”</p>

<p>“Dada,” she said very gently, “I love Freddy. All
the time I was away I was testing myself—honestly
and truly trying to forget him. I didn’t hear from
him and I didn’t send him even a postcard. But now
that I’m back it’s all just the same. We do love each
other; he’s the only man in the world that can ever
make me happy. Please—don’t say no!”</p>

<p>He got up slowly, and walked the length of the veranda
and came back to find her leaning against one
of the pillars.</p>

<p>“Now, Leila,” he began sharply, “we’ve been all
over this, and I thought you realized that a marriage
with that man would be a mistake—a grave blunder.
He’s playing upon your sympathy—telling you, no
doubt, what a great mistake he made in his first venture.”</p>

<p>“I’ve seen him only once since I got back and that
was the other night at the club,” she replied patiently.
“Freddy’s no cry-baby; you know you couldn’t find
a single thing against him except the divorce, and that
wasn’t his fault. He’s perfectly willing to answer any
questions you want to ask him. Isn’t that fair enough?”</p>

<p>“You expect me to treat with him—listen to his
nasty scandal! I’ve told you it won’t do! There’s
never been a divorce in our family—nor in your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">[326]</span>
mother’s family! I feel strongly about it. The thing
has got too common; it’s taken away all the sanctity
of marriage! And that I should welcome as a husband
for a young girl like you a man who has had another
wife—a woman who’s still living—keeping his name, I
understand—I tell you, Leila, it won’t do! It’s my
duty to protect you from such a thing. I have wanted
you to take a high position in this community—such
a position as your mother held; and can you imagine
yourself doing it as the second wife of a man who’s
not of our circle, not our kind at all?”</p>

<p>He flung round, took a few quick steps and then
returned to the attack.</p>

<p>“I want this matter to be disposed of now. What
would our friends think of me if I let you do such a
thing? They’d think I’d lost my mind! I tell you it’s
not in keeping with our position—with your position
as my daughter—to let you make a marriage that
would change the whole tone of the family. If you’ll
think a little more about this I believe you’ll see just
what the step means. I want the best for you. I don’t
believe your happiness depends on your marrying this
man. I may as well tell you bluntly now that I can
never reconcile myself to the idea of your marrying
him. I’ve thought it all over in all its aspects. You’ve
never had a care nor a worry in your life. When you
marry I want you to start even—with a man who’s
your equal in the world’s eyes.”</p>

<p>He had delivered this a little oratorically, with a
gesture or two, and one might have thought that he
was pleased with his phrases. Leila in her simple
summer gown, with one hand at her side, the other
thrust into the silk sash at her waist, seemed singularly
young as she stood with her back to the pillar.
The light from the windows, mingled with the starlight<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">[327]</span>
and moonlight playing upon her face, made it
possible to watch the effect of his words. The effect,
if any, was too obscure for his vision. Her eyes
apparently were not seeing him at all; he might as
well have addressed himself to one of the veranda
chairs for any satisfaction he derived from his speech.</p>

<p>It was on his tongue to pile up additional arguments
against the marriage; but this unresisting Leila with
her back to the pillar exasperated him. And all those
months that they had traveled about together, with
never a mention of Thomas; when she had even indulged
in mild flirtations with men who became their
fellow travelers for a day, she had carried in her heart
this determination to marry Thomas. And he, Franklin
Mills, had stupidly believed that she was forgetting
the man....</p>

<p>He again walked the length of the veranda, and as
he retraced his steps she met him by the door.</p>

<p>“Well, Dada, shall we drive in?” she asked, quite
as though nothing had happened.</p>

<p>“I suppose we may as well start,” he said and looked
at his watch to hide his embarrassment rather than
to learn the time.</p>

<p>On the way into town she recurred to incidents of
their travels and manifested great interest in changes
he proposed making in his conservatories to embrace
some ideas he had gathered in England; but she did
not refer in any way to Thomas. When they reached
home she kissed him good-night and went at once to
her room.</p>

<p>The house was stifling from the torrid day and
Mills wished himself back at the farm. His chief
discomfort was not physical, however; Leila had eluded
him, taken refuge in the inconsequential and irrelevant
in her own peculiar, capricious fashion. It was not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">[328]</span>
in his nature to discuss his affairs or ask counsel,
but he wished there were someone he could talk to....
Millicent might help him in his perplexity. He went
out on the lawn and looked across the hedge at the
Hardens’, hearing voices and laughter. The mirth was
like a mockery.</p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>On the following day Bruce and Millicent drove to
the Faraway club for golf. He was unable to detect
any signs indicating that Mills’s return had affected
Millicent. She spoke of him as she might have spoken
of any other neighbor. Bruce wasn’t troubled about
Mills when he was with Millicent; it was when he was
away from her that he was preyed upon by apprehensions.
He could never marry her: but Mills should
never marry her. This repeated itself in his mind like a
child’s rigamarole. Their game kept them late and it
was after six when they left the club in Bruce’s roadster.</p>

<p>Millicent was beside him; their afternoon together
had been unusually enjoyable. He had every reason
to believe that she preferred his society to that of any
other man she knew. He had taken a route into town
that was longer than the one usually followed, and
in passing through a small village an exclamation from
Millicent caused him to stop the car.</p>

<p>“Wasn’t that Leila and Fred at the gas station?”
she asked. “Let’s go back and see.”</p>

<p>Leila saluted them with a wave of the hand. Thomas
was speaking to the keeper of the station.</p>

<p>“Hello, children!” Leila greeted them. “Pause and
be sociable. What have you been up to?”</p>

<p>“Shooting a little golf,” Millicent answered. “Why
didn’t you drop the word that you were going to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">[329]</span>
club for dinner? You might have had a little company!”</p>

<p>Bruce strolled over to Thomas, who was still conferring
with the station keeper. He heard the man
answer some question as to the best route to a neighboring
town. Thomas seemed a trifle nervous and
glanced impatiently toward Leila and Millicent.</p>

<p>“Hello, Bruce,” he said cheerfully, “how’s everything?”</p>

<p>“Skimming!” said Bruce, and they walked back
to the car, where Thomas greeted Millicent exuberantly.
Leila leaned out and whispered to Bruce:</p>

<p>“We’ll be married in an hour. Don’t tell Millie
till you get home!”</p>

<p>“Are you kidding?” Bruce demanded.</p>

<p>“Certainly not!”</p>

<p>“But why do it this way?”</p>

<p>“Oh—it’s simpler and a lot more romantic—that’s
all! Tell Millie that everything is all right! Don’t
look so scared! All right, Freddy, let’s go!”</p>

<p>Their car was quickly under way and Millicent and
Bruce resumed their homeward drive.</p>

<p>“Leila didn’t tell me she was going to the club with
Freddy,” remarked Millicent pensively.</p>

<p>“One of those spontaneous things,” Bruce replied
carelessly.</p>

<p>When they reached the Hardens’ he walked with
her to the door.</p>

<p>“That was odd—meeting Leila and Fred,” said
Millicent. “Do you think they were really going to
the club for supper?”</p>

<p>“They were not going there,” Bruce replied.
“They’re on their way to be married.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m sorry!” she said and her eyes filled with
tears. The privilege of seeing tears in Millicent’s eyes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">[330]</span>
was to Bruce an experience much more important than
Leila’s marriage.</p>

<p>“It will be a blow to Mr. Mills,” said Bruce thoughtfully.
“Let’s hope he accepts it gracefully.”</p>

<p>Both turned by a common impulse and their eyes
rested upon the Mills house beyond the hedge....</p>

<p>The town buzzed for a few days after Leila’s elopement,
but in her immediate circle it created no surprise.
It was like Leila; she could always be depended
upon to do things differently. Mills, receiving the
news from Leila by telephone, had himself conveyed
the announcement to the newspapers, giving the impression
that there had been no objection to the marriage
and that the elopement was due to his daughter’s
wish to avoid a formal wedding. This had the effect
of killing the marriage as material for sensational
news. It was not Mills’s way to permit himself to be
flashed before his fellow citizens as an outraged and
storming father. Old friends who tried to condole
with him found their sympathy unwelcome. He personally
saw to the packing of the effects Leila telegraphed
for to be sent to Pittsburg, where she and her
husband, bound for a motor trip through the east,
were to pause for a visit with Thomas’s parents.</p>

</div>


<h3>I</h3>

<p>Bruce returned late one afternoon in August from a
neighboring town where Freeman had some houses
under construction, found the office deserted, and was
looking over the accumulation of papers on his desk
when a messenger delivered a telegram.</p>

<p>He signed for it and let it lie while he filled his pipe.
The potentialities of an unopened telegram are enormous.
This message, Bruce reflected, might be from
one of Freeman’s clients with whom he had been dealing
directly; or it might be from a Tech classmate
who had written a week earlier that he would be
motoring through town and would wire definitely the
hour of his arrival. Or it might be the verdict of the
jury of architects who were to pass on the plans for
the Laconia memorial—an honorable mention at best.
The decision had been delayed and he had been trying
to forget about it. He turned the envelope over—assured
himself that it didn’t matter greatly whether
he received the award or not; then, unable to prolong
the agony, he tore it open and read:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It affords the committee great pleasure to
inform you that your plans submitted for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">[332]</span>
Laconia memorial have been accepted. You
may regard our delay in reaching the decision
as complimentary, for the high merit of some
half dozen of the plans proposed made it extremely
difficult to reach a conclusion. We
suggest that you visit Laconia as soon as possible
to make the acquaintance of the citizens’
committee with whom you will now take
up the matter of construction. With our
warm cordial congratulations and all good
wishes....</p>
</div>

<p>He flung his pipe on the floor with a bang, snatched
the telephone and called Freeman’s house. Dale answered,
gave a chirrup of delight and ran to carry
the news to Bill on the tennis court. Bruce decided
that Henderson should know next, and had called the
number when Bud strolled into the room.</p>

<p>“Looking for me—most remarkable! I was on this
floor looking for a poor nut who needs a little stimulus
as to the merits of the world-famous Plantag!”</p>

<p>“Fool!” shouted Bruce, glaring at him. “Don’t
speak to me of Plantagenets. Read that telegram;
read it and fall upon your knees! I’ve won a prize,
I tell you! You called me a chicken-coop builder, did
you? You said I’d better settle down to building low-priced
bungalows—— Oh, yes, you did!”</p>

<p>He was a boy again, lording it over his chum. He
danced about, tapping Bud on the head and shoulders
as if teasing him for a fight. Bud finally managed to
read the message Bruce had thrust into his hands, and
emitted a yell. They fell to pummeling each other
joyfully until Bud sank exhausted into a chair.</p>

<p>“Great Jupiter!” Bud panted. “So this is what
you were up to all spring! We’ll have a celebration!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">[333]</span>
My dear boy, don’t bother about anything—I’ll arrange
it all!”</p>

<p>He busied himself at the telephone while Bruce
received a newspaper reporter who had been sent to
interview him. A bunch of telegrams arrived from
Laconia—salutations of old friends, a congratulatory
message from the memorial committee asking when
they might expect him. The members of the committee
were all men and women he had known from childhood,
and his heart grew big at the pride they showed
in him. In the reception room he had difficulty in composing
himself sufficiently to answer the reporter’s questions
with the composure the occasion demanded....</p>

<p>“Small and select—that’s my idea!” said Bud in
revealing his plans for the celebration. “We’re
going to pull it at Shep Mills’s—Shep won’t listen to
anything else! And the Freemans will be there, and
Millie, and Helen Torrence, and Maybelle’s beating it
from the country club to be sure she doesn’t miss anything.
Thank God! something’s happened to give me
an excuse for acquiring a large, juicy bun.”</p>

<p>“Oh, thunder! You’re going to make an ass of me!
I don’t want any party!”</p>

<p>“No false modesty! We’re all set. I’ll skip around
to the Club and nail Carroll and Whitford and any of
the boys who are there. I’ll bet your plans are rotten,
but we’ll pretend they’re mar-ve-li-ous! You’ll probably
bluff your way through life just on your figure!”</p>

<p>“But there’s no reason why the Shep Millses should
be burdened with your show! Why didn’t you ask me
about that?”</p>

<p>“Oh, their house is bigger than mine. And Shep
stammered his head off demanding that he have the
honor. Don’t worry, old hoss, you’re in the hands of
your friends!”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">[334]</span>The party overflowed from the house into the
grounds, Bud having invited everyone he thought
likely to contribute to its gaiety. Many did not know
just what it was all about, or thought it was one of
Bud’s jokes. He had summoned a jazz band and
cleared the living-room for dancing.</p>

<p>“Bud was unusually crazy when he telephoned me,”
said Millicent. “I don’t quite know what you’ve done,
but it must be a world-shaking event.”</p>

<p>“All of that! The good wishes you sent after the
mail train on a certain night did the business. I’d
have told you of my adventure, only I was afraid I’d
draw a blank.”</p>

<p>“I see. You thought of me as only a fair-weather
friend. Square yourself by telling me everything.”</p>

<p>Their quiet corner of the veranda was soon invaded.
Carroll, Whitford, Connie and Mrs. Torrence joined
them, declaring that Millicent couldn’t be allowed to
monopolize the hero of the hour.</p>

<p>“It’s only beginner’s luck; that’s all,” Bruce protested.
“The pleasantest thing about it is that it’s my
native burg; that does tickle me!”</p>

<p>“It’s altogether splendid,” said Carroll. “Having
seen you on your native heath, and knowing how the
people over there feel about you, I know just how
proud you ought to be.”</p>

<p>“What’s the name of the place—Petronia?” asked
Constance.</p>

<p>“Laconia,” Carroll corrected her. “You will do well
to fix it in your memory now that Bruce is making it
famous. I might mention that I have some cousins
there—Bruce went over with me not so long ago just
to give me a good character.”</p>

<p>“How very interesting,” Constance murmured.</p>

<p>“Mr. Mills once lived for a time in Laconia,” Carroll<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">[335]</span>
remarked. “That was years ago. His father had
acquired some business interests there and the place
aspired to become a large city.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe I ever heard Mr. Mills speak of it;
I thought he was always rooted here,” said Constance.</p>

<p>The party broke up at midnight, and Bruce drove
Millicent home through the clear summer night. When
he had unlocked the door for her she followed him out
upon the steps.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid I haven’t said all I’d like to say about
your success. It’s a big achievement. I want you to
know that I realize all that. I’m glad—and proud.
Many happy returns of the day!”</p>

<p>She gave him both her hands and this more than
her words crowned the day for him. He had never
been so happy. He really had hold of life; he could
do things, he could do much finer things than the Laconia
memorial! On his way to the gate he saw
beyond the hedge a shadowy figure moving across the
Mills lawn. When he reached the street he glanced
back, identified Mills, and on an impulse entered the
grounds. Mills was pacing back and forth, his head
bowed, his hands thrust into his pockets. He started
when he discerned Bruce, who walked up to him
quickly.</p>

<p>“Oh—that you, Storrs? Glad to see you! It’s a
sultry night and I’m staying out as long as possible.”</p>

<p>“I stopped to tell you a little piece of news. The
Laconia memorial jury has made its report; my plans
are accepted.”</p>

<p>“How fine! Why—I’m delighted to hear this. I
hope everything’s as you wanted it.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir; the fund was increased and the thing can
be done now without skimping. I put in the fountain—I’m<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">[336]</span>
greatly obliged to you for that suggestion. You
ought to have the credit for it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, no!” Mills exclaimed hastily. “You’d probably
have thought of it yourself—merely a bit of supplementary
decoration. You’ll be busy now—supervising
the construction?”</p>

<p>“Yes; I want to look after all the details. It will
keep me busy for the next year. Carroll is going over
to Laconia with me tomorrow.”</p>

<p>“Good! It will be quite an event—going back to
your old home to receive the laurel! I hope your work
will stand for centuries!”</p>

<p>“Thank you, sir; good-night.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO</h2>
</div>


<h3>I</h3>

<p>Brief notes from Leila announced the happy course
of her honeymoon in the New England hills. She
wrote to her father as though there had been nothing
extraordinary in her flight. Mills’s mortification that
his daughter should have married over his protest was
ameliorated by the satisfaction derived from dealing
magnanimously with her. The Mills dignity required
that she have a home in keeping with the family status,
and he would provide for this a sum equal to the amount
he had given Shep to establish himself. He avoided
Shep and Connie—the latter misguidedly bent upon
trying to reconcile him to the idea that Leila had not
done so badly. He suspected that Connie, in her heart,
was laughing at him, rejoicing that Leila had beaten
him.</p>

<p>He saw Millicent occasionally; but for all her tact
and an evident wish to be kind, he suspected that her
friendliness merely expressed her sympathy, and sympathy
from any quarter was unbearable. He felt age
clutching at him; he questioned whether Millicent could
ever care for him; his dream of marrying again had
been sheer folly. The summer wore on monotonously.
Mills showed himself at the country club occasionally,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">[338]</span>
usually at the behest of some of his old friends, and
several times he entertained at Deer Trail.</p>

<p>Shep and Connie were to dine with him in the town
house one evening, and when he had dressed he went,
as he often did, into Leila’s room. He sat down and
idly drew the books from a rack on the table. One of
them was a slender volume of George Whitford’s
poems, printed privately and inscribed, “To Leila, from
her friend, the author.” Mills had not heard of the
publication and he turned over the leaves with more
curiosity than he usually manifested in volumes of
verse. Whitford’s lyrics were chiefly in a romantic
and sentimental vein. One of them, the longest in
the book, was called “The Flower of the World,” and
above the title Leila had scrawled “Connie.”</p>

<p>The lines were an ardent tribute to a lady whom the
poet declared to be his soul’s ideal. Certain phrases
underscored by Leila’s impious pencil were, when taken
collectively, a very fair description of Constance. Mills
carried the book to the library for a more deliberate
perusal. If Leila knew that Constance was the subject
of the verses, others must know it. What his
sister had said about Whitford’s devotion to Constance
was corroborated by the verses; and there had
been that joint appearance of Constance and Whitford
in the dramatic club play—another damning circumstance.
Mills’s ire was aroused. He was standing in
the middle of the room searching for other passages
that might be interpreted as the author’s tribute to
Constance when Shep entered.</p>

<p>“Good evening, father,” he said. “We’re a little
early—I thought we might take a minute to speak of
those B. and F. bonds. You know——”</p>

<p>He paused as his father, without preliminary greeting,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">[339]</span>
advanced toward him with an angry gleam in his
eyes.</p>

<p>“Look at that! Have you seen this thing?”</p>

<p>“Why, yes, I’ve seen it,” Shepherd answered, glancing
at the page. “It’s a little book of George’s; he
gave copies to all his friends—said nobody would ever
buy it!”</p>

<p>“Gave copies to all his friends, did he? Do you see
what Leila’s written here and those marked lines? Do
you realize what it means—that it’s written to your
wife?”</p>

<p>“That’s ridiculous, father,” Shep stammered. “It’s
not written to Connie any more than to any other
young woman—a sort of ideal of George’s, I suppose.
Connie’s name written there is just a piece of Leila’s
nonsense.”</p>

<p>“How many people do you suppose thought the
same thing? Don’t you know that there’s been a good
deal of unpleasant talk about Connie and Whitford?
There was that play they appeared in—written by
Whitford! I’ve heard about that! It caused a lot of
talk, and you’ve stood by, blind and deaf, and haven’t
done a thing to stop it!”</p>

<p>“I can’t have you make such statements about Connie!
There was nothing wrong with that play—absolutely
nothing! It was one of the finest things the
club ever had. As for George having Connie in mind
when he wrote that poem—why, that’s ridiculous!
George is my friend as much as Connie’s. Why, I
haven’t a better friend in the world than George Whitford!”</p>

<p>“You’re blind; you’re stupid!” Mills stormed. “How
many people do you suppose have laughed over that—laughed
at you as a fool to let a man make love to your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">[340]</span>
wife in that open fashion? I tell you the thing’s got
to stop!”</p>

<p>“But, father,” said Shep, lowering his voice, “you
wouldn’t insult Connie. She’s downstairs and might
easily hear you. You know, father, Connie isn’t exactly
well! Connie’s going—Connie’s going—to have
a baby! We’re very, very happy—about it——”</p>

<p>Shep, stammering as he blurted this out, had endeavored
to invest the announcement with the dignity
it demanded.</p>

<p>“So there’s a child coming!” There was no mistaking
the sneer in Mills’s voice. “Your wife has a
lover and she is to have a child!”</p>

<p>“You shan’t say such a thing!” cried Shep, his
voice tremulous with wrath and horror. “You’re
crazy! It’s unworthy of you!”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m sane enough. You ought to have seen
this and stopped it long ago. Now that you see it,
I’d like to know what you’re going to do about it!”</p>

<p>“But I don’t see it! There’s nothing to see! I tell
you I’ll not listen to such an infamous charge against
Connie!”</p>

<p>“I’ll say what I please about Connie!” Mills shouted.
“You children—you and Leila—what have I got from
you but disappointment and shame? Leila runs away
and marries a scoundrel out of the divorce court and
now your wife—a woman I tried to save you from—has
smirched us all with dishonor. I didn’t want you
to marry her; I begged you not to do it. But I yielded
in the hope of making you happy. I wanted you and
Leila to take the place you’re entitled to in this town.
Everything was done for you! Look up there,” he
went on hoarsely, pointing to the portraits above the
book shelves, “look at those men and women—your
forebears—people who laid the foundations of this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">[341]</span>
town, and they look down on you and what do they
see? Failure! Disgrace! Nothing but failure! And
you stand here and pretend—pretend——”</p>

<p>Mills’s arm fell to his side and the sentence died on
his lips. Constance stood in the door; there were
angry tears in her eyes and her face was white as she
advanced a little way into the room and paused before
Mills.</p>

<p>“I did not know how foul—how base you could be!
You needn’t fear him, Shep! Only a coward would
have bawled such a thing for the servants to hear—possibly
the neighbors. You’ve called upon your ancestors,
Mr. Mills, to witness your shame and disgrace
at having admitted me into your sacred family circle!
Shep, have you ever noticed the resemblance—it’s really
quite remarkable—of young Mr. Storrs to your grandfather
Mills? It’s most curious—rather impressive, in
fact!”</p>

<p>She was gazing at the portrait of Franklin Mills III,
with a contemptuous smile on her lips.</p>

<p>“Connie, <i>Connie</i>——” Shep faltered.</p>

<p>“Storrs! What do you mean by that?” demanded
Mills. His mouth hung open; with his head thrust forward
he gazed at the portrait as if he had never seen
it before.</p>

<p>“Nothing, of course,” she went on slowly, giving
every effect to her words. “But when you spent some
time in that town with the singular name—Laconia,
wasn’t it?—you were young and probably quite fascinating—Storrs
came from there—an interesting—a
wholly admirable young man!”</p>

<p>“Connie—I don’t get what you’re driving at!” Shep
exclaimed, his eyes fastened upon his grandfather’s
portrait.</p>

<p>“Constance is merely trying to be insolent,” Mills<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">[342]</span>
said, but his hand shook as he took a cigarette from a
box and lighted it. When he looked up he was disconcerted
to find Shep regarding him with a blank stare.
Constance, already at the door, said quietly:</p>

<p>“Come, Shep. I think we must be going.”</p>

<p>The silence of the house was broken in a moment
by the closing of the front door.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>Shep and Constance drove in silence the few blocks
that lay between Mills’s house and their own. Constance
explained their return to the maid by saying
that she hadn’t felt well and ordered a cold supper
served in the breakfast room. Shep strolled aimlessly
about while she went upstairs and reappeared in a
house gown. When they had eaten they went into the
living-room, where she turned the leaves of a book
while he pretended to read the evening newspaper.
After a time she walked over to him and touched his
arm, let her hand rest lightly on his head.</p>

<p>“Yes, Connie,” he said.</p>

<p>“There’s something I want to say to you, Shep.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Connie.”</p>

<p>He got up and she slipped into his chair.</p>

<p>“It’s a lie, Shep. What your father said is a lie!”</p>

<p>“Yes; of course,” he said, but he did not look at her.</p>

<p>“You’ve got to believe me; I’ll die if you don’t tell
me you believe in me!” and her voice broke in a sob.</p>

<p>He walked away from her, then went back, staring
at her dully.</p>

<p>“I’ve been foolish, Shep. George and I have been
good friends; we’ve enjoyed talking books and music.
I like the things he likes, but that’s all. You’ve got
to believe me, Shep; you’ve got to believe me!”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">[343]</span>There was deep passion in the reiterated appeal.</p>

<p>When he did not reply she rose, clasped his cheeks
in her hands so that he could not avoid her eyes.</p>

<p>“Look at me, Shep. I swear before God I am telling
you the truth!”</p>

<p>“Yes, Connie.” He freed himself, walked to the
end of the room, went back to her, regarding her intently.
“Connie—what did you mean by what you
said to father about Bruce Storrs?”</p>

<p>“Oh, nothing! Your aunt Alice spoke of the resemblance
one night at the country club, where she saw
Bruce with Millicent. It’s rather striking when you
think of it. And then at Bruce’s jollification the other
night Arthur said your father once spent some time
at Laconia. I thought possibly he had relatives there.”</p>

<p>“No; never, I think.”</p>

<p>“That’s what your aunt Alice said; but the portrait
does suggest Bruce Storrs.”</p>

<p>“Or a hundred other men,” Shep replied with a
shrug. “You must be tired, Connie—you’d better go
to bed.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe we’ve quite finished, Shep. I can’t
leave you like this! Your father is a beast! A low,
foul beast!”</p>

<p>“I suppose he is,” he said indifferently.</p>

<p>“Is that all you have to say to me—Shep?”</p>

<p>She regarded him with growing terror in her eyes.
He had said he believed her, but it was in a tone of
unbelief.</p>

<p>“I suppose a wife has a right to the protection of
her husband,” she said challengingly.</p>

<p>“You heard what I said to father, didn’t you? I told
him it was a lie. I’ll never enter his house again.
That ought to satisfy you,” he said with an air of dismissing
the matter finally.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">[344]</span>“And this is all you have to say, Shep?”</p>

<p>“It’s enough, isn’t it? I don’t care to discuss the
matter further.”</p>

<p>“Then this is the end—is that what you mean?”</p>

<p>“No,” he replied in a curious, strained tone. “It’s
foolish to say what the end of anything is going to be.”</p>

<p>She looked at him a moment pleadingly and with a
gesture of helplessness started toward the door. He
opened it for her, followed her into the hall, pressed
the buttons that lighted the rooms above, and returned
to the living-room....</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>Their routine continued much as it had been for the
past two years, but to her tortured senses there was
something ominous now in the brevity of their contacts.
Shep often remained away late and on his return
crept softly upstairs to his room without speaking to
her, though she left her light burning brightly.</p>

<p>Constance kept to her room, she hadn’t been well,
and the doctor told her to stay in bed for a few days.
For several nights she heard Shep moving about his
room, and the maid told her that he had been going
over his clothing and was sending a box of old suits
to some charitable institution. A few days later he
went into her room as she was having breakfast in
bed. She asked him to shift the tray for her, more
for something to say than because the service was
necessary, and inquired if he were feeling well, but
without dispelling the hard glitter that had become
fixed in his eyes.</p>

<p>“Do you know when Leila’s coming home?” he inquired
from the foot of the bed.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">[345]</span>“No; I haven’t heard. I’ve seen no one; the doctor
told me to keep quiet.”</p>

<p>“Yes; I suppose you have to do that,” he said without
emotion. He went out listlessly and as he passed
her she put out her hand, touched his sleeve; but he
gave no sign that he was aware of the appeal the gesture
implied....</p>

<p>It was on a Saturday morning that he went in
through his dressing room, bade her good morning in
much his old manner and rang for her coffee. He had
breakfasted, he said, and merely wanted to be sure
that she was comfortable.</p>

<p>“Thank you, Shep. I’m all right. I’ve been troubled
about you, dear—much more than about myself. But
you look quite fit this morning.”</p>

<p>“Feeling fine,” he said. “This is a half day at the
office and I want to get on the job early. I’m dated
up for a foursome this afternoon with George, Bruce
and Carroll; so I won’t be home till after the game.
You won’t mind?”</p>

<p>“Why, I’m delighted to have you go, Shep!”</p>

<p>“I always do the best I can, Connie,” he went on
musingly. “I probably make a lot of mistakes. I don’t
believe God intended me for heavy work; if he had
he’d have made me bigger.”</p>

<p>“How foolish, Shep. You’re doing wonderfully.
Isn’t everything going smoothly at the office?”</p>

<p>“Just fine! I haven’t a thing to complain of!”</p>

<p>“Is everything all right now?” she asked, encouraged
to hope for some assurance of his faith in her.</p>

<p>“What isn’t all right will be—there’s always that!”
he replied with a laugh.</p>

<p>He lingered beside the bed and took her hand, bent
over and kissed her, let his cheek rest against hers in
an old way of his.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">[346]</span>“Good-bye,” he said from the door, and then with
a smile—Shep’s familiar, wistful little smile—he left
her.</p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>Shep and Whitford won the foursome against Bruce
and Carroll, a result due to Whitford’s superior drives
and Carroll’s bad putting. They were all in high
humor when they returned to the clubhouse, chaffing
one another about their skill as they dressed. Shep
made a tour of the verandas, greeting his friends, answering
questions as to Connie’s health. The four
men were going in at once and Shep, who had driven
Carroll out, suggested that he and Bruce change partners
for the drive home.</p>

<p>“There are a few little points about the game I want
to discuss with George,” he explained as they walked
toward the parking sheds.</p>

<p>“All right,” Bruce assented cheerfully. “You birds
needn’t be so set up; next week Carroll and I will give
you the trimming of your young lives!”</p>

<p>“Ah, the next time!” Shep replied ironically, and
drove away with Whitford beside him....</p>

<p>“Shep’s coming on; he’s matured a lot since he went
into the trust company,” remarked Carroll, as he and
Bruce followed Shep’s car.</p>

<p>“Good stuff in him,” said Bruce. “One of those
natures that develops slowly. I never saw him quite
as gay as he was this afternoon.”</p>

<p>“He was always a shy boy, but he’s coming out of
that. I think his father was wise in taking him out
of the battery plant.”</p>

<p>“No doubt,” Bruce agreed, his attention fixed on
Shep’s car.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">[347]</span>Shep had set a pace that Bruce was finding it difficult
to maintain. Carroll presently commented upon
the wild flight of the car ahead, which was cutting
the turns in the road with reckless abandon, leaving a
gray cloud behind.</p>

<p>“The honor of my car is at stake!” said Bruce grimly,
closing his windshield against the dust.</p>

<p>“By George! If Shep wasn’t so abstemious you’d
think he’d mixed alcohol with his gas,” Carroll replied.
“What the devil’s got into him!”</p>

<p>“Maybe he wants a race,” Bruce answered uneasily,
remembering Shep’s wild drive the night of their talk
on the river. “There’s a bad turn at the creek just
ahead—he can’t make it at that speed!”</p>

<p>Bruce stopped, thinking Shep might check his flight
if he found he wasn’t pursued; but the car sped steadily
on.</p>

<p>“Shep’s gone nutty or he’s trying to scare George,”
said Carroll. “Go ahead!”</p>

<p>Bruce started his car at full speed, expecting that at
any minute Shep would stop and explain that it was
all a joke of some kind. The flying car was again in
sight, careening crazily as it struck depressions in the
roadbed.</p>

<p>“Oh, God!” cried Carroll, half-rising in his seat.
Shep had passed a lumbering truck by a hair’s breadth,
and still no abatement in his speed. Bruce heard a
howl of rage as he swung his own car past the truck.
A danger sign at the roadside gave warning of the
short curve that led upward to the bridge, and Bruce
clapped on his brakes. Carroll, on the running board,
peering ahead through the dust, yelled, and as Bruce
leaped out a crash ahead announced disaster. A second
sound, the sound of a heavy body falling, greeted
the two men as they ran toward the scene....</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">[348]</span>Shep’s car had battered through the wooden fence
that protected the road where it curved into the wooden
bridge and had plunged into the narrow ravine. Bruce
and Carroll flung themselves down the steep bank and
into the stream. Shep’s head lay across his arms on
the wheel; Whitford evidently had tried to leap out
before the car struck. His body, half out of the door,
had been crushed against the fence, but clung in its place
through the car’s flight over the embankment.</p>


<h3>V</h3>

<p>To the world Franklin Mills showed what passed
for a noble fortitude and a superb resignation in Shep’s
death. Carroll had carried the news to him; and Carroll
satisfied the curiosity of no one as to what Mills had
said or how he had met the blow. Carroll himself did
not know what passed through Franklin Mills’ mind.
Mills had asked without emotion whether the necessary
things had been done, and was satisfied that Carroll had
taken care of everything. Mills received the old friends
who called, among them Lindley. It was a proper thing
to see the minister in such circumstances. The rector
of St. Barnabas went away puzzled. He had never
understood Mills, and now his rich parishioner was
more of an enigma than ever.</p>

<p>A handful of friends chosen by Constance and Mills
heard the reading of the burial office in the living-room
of Shep’s house. Constance remained in her room;
and Mills saw her first when they met in the hall to
drive together to the cemetery, an arrangement that
she herself had suggested. No sound came from her
as she stood between Mills and Leila at the grave as the
last words were said. A little way off stood the bearers,
young men who had been boyhood friends of Shep, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">[349]</span>
one or two of his associates from the trust company.
When the grave was filled Constance waited, watching
the placing of the flowers, laying her wreath of roses
with her own hands.</p>

<p>She took Mills’s arm and they returned to their car.
No word was spoken as it traversed the familiar streets.
The curtains were drawn; Mills stared fixedly at the
chauffeur’s back; the woman beside him made no sign.
Nothing, as he thought of it, had been omitted; his
son had been buried with the proper rites of the church.
There had been no bungling, no hysterical display of
grief; no crowd of the morbidly curious. When they
reached Shep’s house he followed Constance in. There
were women there waiting to care for her, but she
sent them away and went into the reception parlor.
The scent of flowers still filled the rooms, but the house
had assumed its normal orderly aspect. Constance
threw back her veil, and Mills saw for the first time
her face with its marks of suffering, her sorrowing
eyes.</p>

<p>“Had you something to say to me?” she asked
quietly.</p>

<p>“If you don’t mind——” he answered. “I couldn’t
come to you before—but now—I should like you to
know——”</p>

<p>As he paused she began to speak slowly, as if reciting
something she had committed to memory.</p>

<p>“We have gone through this together, for reasons
clear to both of us. There is nothing you can say to
me. But one or two things I must say to you. You
killed him. Your contempt for him as a weaker man
than you, as a gentle and sweet soul you could never
comprehend; your wish to manage him, to thwart him
in things he wanted to do, your wish to mold him and
set him in your own little groove—these are the things<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">[350]</span>
that destroyed him. You shattered his faith in me—that
is the crudest thing of all, for he loved me. So
strong was your power over him and so great was his
fear of you that he believed you. In spite of himself
he believed you when you charged me with unfaithfulness.
You drove him mad,” she went on monotonously;
“he died a madman—died horribly, carrying an innocent
man down with him. The child Shep wanted so
much—that he would have loved so dearly—is his.
You need have no fear as to that. That is all I have
to say, Mr. Mills.”</p>

<p>She left him noiselessly, leaving behind her a quiet
that terrified and numbed him. He found himself
groping his way through the hall, where someone spoke
to him. The words were unintelligible, though the voice
was of someone who meant to be kind. He walked to
his car, carrying his hat as if he were unequal to the
effort of lifting it to his head. The chauffeur opened
the door, and as he got in Mills stumbled and sank upon
the seat.</p>

<p>When he reached home he wandered aimlessly about
the rooms, oppressed by the intolerable quiet. One and
another of the servants furtively peered at him from
discreet distances; the man who had cared for his personal
needs for many years showed himself in the hope
of being called upon for some service.</p>

<p>“Is that you, Briggs?” asked Mills. “Please call
the farm and say that I’m coming out. Yes—I’ll have
dinner there. I may stay a day or two. You may
pack a bag for me—the usual things. Order the car
when you’re ready.”</p>

<p>He resumed his listless wandering, found himself in
Leila’s old room, and again in the room that had been
Shep’s. It puzzled him to find that the inspection of
these rooms brought him no sensations. He felt no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">[351]</span>
inclination to cry out against the fate that had wrought
this emptiness, laid this burden of silence upon his
house. Leila had gone; and he had seen them put
Shep into the ground.</p>

<p>“<i>You killed him.</i>” This was what that woman in
black had said. She had said other things, but these
were the words that repeated themselves in his memory
like a muffled drum-beat. On the drive to the farm he
did not escape from the insistent reiteration. He was
mystified, bewildered. No one had ever spoken to him
like that; no one had ever before accused him of a
monstrous crime or addressed him as if he were a contemptible
and odious thing. And yet he was Franklin
Mills. This was the astounding thing,—that Franklin
Mills should have listened to such words and been
unable to deny them....</p>

<p>At the farm he paused on the veranda, turned his
face westward where the light still lingered in pale
tints of gold and scarlet. He remained staring across
the level fields, hearing the murmur of the wind in
the maples, the rustle of dead leaves in the grass, until
the chauffeur spoke to him, took his arm and led him
into the house.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE</h2>
</div>


<h3>I</h3>

<p>Carroll and Bruce dined at the University Club on
an evening early in October. The tragic end of Shepherd
Mills and George Whitford had brought them
into a closer intimacy and they were much together.
The responsibility of protecting Shep’s memory had
fallen upon them; and they had been fairly successful
in establishing in local history a record of the tragedy
as an accident. Only a very few knew or suspected
the truth.</p>

<p>“Have you anything on this evening?” asked Carroll
as they were leaving the table.</p>

<p>“Not a blessed thing,” Bruce replied.</p>

<p>“Mr. Mills, you know, or rather you don’t know, is
at Deer Trail. The newspaper story that he had gone
south for the winter wasn’t true. He’s been ill—frightfully
ill; but he’s better now. I was out there
today; he asked about you. I think he’d like to see you.
You needn’t dread it; he’s talked very little about Shep’s
death.”</p>

<p>“If you really think he wants to see me,” Bruce
replied dubiously.</p>

<p>“From the way he mentioned you I’m sure it would
please him.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">[353]</span>“Very well; will you go along?”</p>

<p>“No; I think he’d like it better if you went alone.
He has seen no one but Leila, the doctor and me; he’s
probably anxious to see a new face. I’ll telephone
you’re coming.”</p>

<p>As Bruce entered Mills’s room a white-frocked nurse
quietly withdrew. The maid who had shown him up
drew a chair beside the bed and left them. He was
alone with Mills, trying to adjust himself to the change
in him, the pallor of the face against the pillow, the
thin cheeks, the hair white now where it had only been
touched with gray.</p>

<p>“This is very kind of you! I’m poor company; but
I hoped you wouldn’t mind running out.”</p>

<p>“I thought you were away. Carroll just told me
you were here.”</p>

<p>“No; I’ve been here sometime—so long, in fact, that
I feel quite out of the world.”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Thomas is at home—I’ve seen her several
times.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Leila’s very good to me; runs out every day
or two. She’s full of importance over having her own
establishment.”</p>

<p>Bruce spoke of his own affairs; told of the progress
that had been made with the Laconia memorial before
the weather became unfavorable. The foundations
were in and the materials were being prepared; the
work would go forward rapidly with the coming of
spring.</p>

<p>“I can appreciate your feeling about it—your own
idea taking form. I’ve thought of it a good deal.
Indeed, I’ve thought of you a great deal since I’ve
been here.”</p>

<p>“If I’d known you were here and cared to see me
I should have come out,” said Bruce quite honestly.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">[354]</span>While Mills bore the marks of suffering and had
plainly undergone a serious illness, his voice had something
of its old resonance and his eyes were clear and
alert. He spoke of Shep, with a poignant tenderness,
but left no opening for sympathy. His grief was his
own; not a thing to be exposed to another or traded
upon. Bruce marveled at him. The man, even in
his weakness, challenged admiration. The rain had
begun to patter on the sill of an open window and
Bruce went to close it. When he returned to the bed
Mills asked for an additional pillow that he might sit
up more comfortably, and Bruce adjusted it for him.
He was silent for a moment; his fingers played with
the edge of the coverlet; he appeared to be thinking
intently.</p>

<p>“There are things, Storrs,” he remarked presently,
“that are not helped by discussion. That night I had
you to dine with me we both played about a certain
fact without meeting it. I am prepared to meet it
now. You are my son. I don’t know that there’s
anything further to be said about it.”</p>

<p>“Nothing,” Bruce answered.</p>

<p>“If you were not what you are I should never have
said this to you. I was in love with your mother and
she loved me. It was all wrong and the wrong was
mine. And in various ways I have paid the penalty.”
He passed his hand slowly over his eyes and went on.
“It may be impertinent, but there’s one thing I’d like
to ask. What moved you to establish yourself here?”</p>

<p>“There was only one reason. My mother was the
noblest woman that ever lived! She loved you till
she died. She would never have told me of you but
for a feeling that she wanted me to be near you—to
help in case you were in need. That was all.”</p>

<p>“That was all?” Mills repeated, and for the first<span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">[355]</span>
time he betrayed emotion. He lay very still. Slowly
his hand moved along the coverlet to the edge of the
bed until Bruce took it in his own. “You and I have
been blessed in our lives; we have known the love of a
great woman. That was like her,” he ended softly;
“that was Marian.”</p>

<p>The nurse came in to see if he needed anything, and
he dismissed her for the night. He went on talking
in quiet, level tones—of his early years, of the changing
world, Bruce encouraging him by an occasional
question but heeding little what he said. If Mills had
whined, begged forgiveness or offered reparation, Bruce
would have hated him. But Mills was not an ordinary
man. No ordinary man would have made the admission
he had made, or, making it, would have implored silence,
exacted promises....</p>

<p>“Millicent—you see her, I suppose?” Mills asked
after a time.</p>

<p>“Yes; I see her quite often.”</p>

<p>“I had hoped you did. In fact Leila told me that
Millie and you are good friends. She said a little
more—Leila’s a discerning person and she said she
thought there was something a little more than friendship.
Please let me finish! You’ve thought that there
were reasons why you could never ask Millicent to
marry you. I’ll take the responsibility of that. I’ll
tell her the story myself—if need be. I leave that to
your own decision.”</p>

<p>“No,” said Bruce. “I shall tell her myself.”</p>

<p>Instead of wearying Mills, the talk seemingly acted
as a stimulus. Bruce’s amazement grew. It was incomprehensible
that here lay the Franklin Mills of his
distrust, his jealousy, his hatred.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">[356]</span>“Millicent used to trouble me a good deal with some
of her ideas,” said Mills.</p>

<p>“She’s troubled a good many of us,” Bruce agreed
with a smile. “But sometimes I think I catch a faint
gleam.”</p>

<p>“I’m sure you do! You two are of a generation
that looks for God in those far horizons she talks
about. The idea amused me at first. But I see now
that here is the new religion—the religion of youth—that
expresses itself truly in beautiful things—in life,
in conduct, in unselfishness. The spirit of youth reveals
itself in beautiful things—and calls them God. Shep
felt all that, tried in his own way to make me see—but
I couldn’t understand him. I—there are things I want
to do—for Shep. We’ll talk of that later....
Every mistake I’ve made, every wrong I’ve done in
this world has been due to selfishness—I’ve been saying
that to myself every day since I’ve been here. I’ve
found peace in it. There’s no one in the world who
has a better right to hear this from me than you. And
this is no death-bed repentance; I’m not going to die
yet a while. It’s rather beaten in on me, Bruce”—it
was the first time he had so addressed him—“that we
can’t just live for ourselves! No! Not if we would
find happiness. There comes a time when every man
needs God. The wise thing is so to live that when the
need comes we shan’t find him a stranger!”</p>

<p>The hour grew late, and the wind and rain made a
continual clatter about the house. When Bruce rose
to go Mills protested.</p>

<p>“There’s plenty of space here—a room next to mine
is ready for a guest. You’ll find everything you want.
We seem to meet in storms! Please spend the night
here.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">[357]</span>And so it came about that for the first time Bruce
slept in his father’s house.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>Bruce and Millicent were married the next June. A
few friends gathered in the garden late on a golden
afternoon—Leila and Thomas, the Freemans, the
Hendersons, a few relatives of the Hardens from their
old home, and Carroll and Bruce’s cousin from Laconia.
The marriage service was read by Dr. Lindley
and the music was provided by a choir of robins in
the elms and maples. Franklin Mills was not present;
but before Bruce and Millicent drove to the station
they passed through the gate in the boundary hedge—Leila
had arranged this—and received his good wishes.</p>

<p>The fourth of July had been set as the time for the
dedication of the memorial. The event brought together
a great company of dignitaries, and the governor
of the state and the Secretary of War were the
speakers. Mills had driven over with Leila and
Thomas, and he sat with them, Millicent beside him.</p>

<p>Bruce hovered on the edges of the crowd, listening
to comments on his work, marveling himself that it
was so good. The chairman of the local committee
sent for him at the conclusion of the ceremonies to
introduce him to the distinguished visitors. When the
throng had dispersed, Millicent, with Carroll and Leila,
paused by the fountain to wait until Bruce was free.</p>

<p>“This is what you get, Millie, for having a famous
husband,” Leila remarked. “He’s probably signing a
contract for another monument!”</p>

<p>“There he is!” exclaimed Carroll, pointing up the
slope.</p>

<p>Bruce and Mills were slowly pacing one of the colonnades.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">[358]</span>
Beyond it lay the woodland that more than met
Bruce’s expectations as a background for the memorial.
They were talking earnestly, wholly unaware that
they were observed. As they turned once more to
retrace their steps Mills, unconsciously it seemed, laid
his arm across Bruce’s shoulders; and Millicent, seeing
and understanding, turned away to hide her tears.</p>
